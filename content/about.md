This is a project to write down and preserve the history of Polish Pro Wrestling.

Currently, this history is spread across many sites: news portals, blogs, forums, other wiki sites similar to this one, video sites, and Cagematch.
However, due to the nature of the (free) web, a lot of this content is no longer accessible, or degraded. The aim of TPW is to list all the wrestling shows that took place in Poland (backyards included), to have bios on all the wrestlers that worked in Poland (domestic and international), and to preserve media that may fall off the face of the Internet - photos and videos of these events.

The official Polish name for this project is "Teczki Polskiego Wrestlingu", which is more like _The Secret Files of Polish Wrestling_. But to keep the acronym consistent, the English name uses _Tales_.

## Sections

**[Events](@/e/_index.md)** lists both past and upcoming events on the Polish wrestling scene.

**[Organizations](@/o/_index.md)** documents active and folded organizations, both pro and backyard. Each article includes the organization's history.

**[People](@/w/_index.md)** is a listing of all talent, local and foreign, that stepped between the ropes in Poland. Some of them have articles of their own, which list their matches in detail, and sometimes include a bio and the character's history.

**[Teams](@/tt/_index.md)** lists tag teams and stables, both domestic and international, that worked in Poland. Unlike the list of people, this one only includes teams of certain notability.

**[Matchfinder](//mf.tpwres.pl)** is a search tool to find all the matches where a given talent or talents appeared. It's also useful for viewing match history of talent who don't have their own article in the People section.
