The Kluczewo airport is a disused military airbase located near the city of Stargard. The German Luftwaffe erected the first buldings in 1925-27 and finished the construction of the airport in 1935. It was later expanded during World War&nbsp;II and taken over by the Red Army in 1945. By 13.10.1992 the remaining Russian forces had left the base, which came under Polish jurisdiction and the following year the area was incorporated into the city of Stargard.

Between 2005 and 2021 the airport was used by the OldTown Festival to hold post-apo LARP events. Between 2016 and 2019 [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) held five shows during the festivals.
