Ergo Arena is a sports and entertainment venue located at the border between Gda≈Ñsk and Sopot, with the official demarcation line dividing the Arena exactly in half. As a result the venue has one street address, but two different postal codes.

Since it was open in 2010, Ergo Arena has been used for a variety of sporting events, concerts, cabarets, exhibitions, conferences etc. The official capacity is up to 15&nbsp;000 people.

In the venue's early years [WWE](@/o/wwe.md) held two events there - a [Smackdown House Show in 2011](@/e/wwe/2011-11-11-wwe-smackdown-house-show.md) and a [RAW House Show in 2012](@/e/wwe/2012-04-12-wwe-raw-house-show.md). Thirteen years later, in August 2025, WWE announced they'd return to Ergo Arena with a [Road to Royal Rumble](@/e/wwe/2026-01-17-wwe-road-to-royal-rumble.md) show in January 2026, as a part of their European tour.
