Gdy≈Ñskie Centrum Sportu (_Gdynia Sports Center_) is a complex of sports facilities located in Gdynia, as well as the name of the city government's subdivision overseeing these facilities. Those include the football stadium used by Arka Gdynia, the multipurpose Gdynia Arena hall most known for hosting volleyball, and the National Rugby Stadium.

Another, older and less flashy building in that complex is the Hall of Games, primarily used for matches between school teams. It is there, that in cooperation with the city, [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) hosted many of their events between 2016 and 2021, with a notable 18-month hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Their first event to be held there was back in 2015, however they were just a side attraction in a larger event - the [Gdynia Game Festival](@/e/kpw/2015-12-11-kpw-ggf.md). That was not held in the Hall of Games, but rather the mentioned Gdynia Arena.
