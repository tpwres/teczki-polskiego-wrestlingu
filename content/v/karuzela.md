Karuzela (_The Carousel_) was a student club in Warsaw, opened in 1955. Over the decades it held numerous concerts, stage and dance performances, film screenings, cabarets, festivals etc. The club fell on hard times in the '90s, but managed to pick up steam in the 2000s alongside the revival of culture life at the Bemowo district of Warsaw.

In the late 2000s [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) chose Karuzela as the venue for their early shows. All together, four events were held in the club before the promotion moved to Rzeszów, to [Klub Pod Palmą](@/v/pod-palma.md).

Karuzela was closed in 2021.
