Mińska&nbsp;65 is an event venue in Warsaw. It held its first wrestling show, [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), in October 2024.

### History

The industrial complex at Mińska&nbsp;65 was built in mid-1950s in the place of "Centralne Warsztaty Samochodowe" (_Central Car Works_) - a pre-war car and motorcycle manufacturer. The building's blueprints were drawn by architects Jerzy Brandysiewicz and Stanisław Zalewski. Mińska&nbsp;65 was the headquarters of the printing house "Drukarnia Naukowo-Techniczna" (_Technical-Scientific Printing House_, formerly known as "Drukarnia im. Rewoulcji Październikowej", _October Revolution Printing House_). It continued to be a printing house up untill 2012, when it shut down its operations. Later on, the complex at Mińska&nbsp;65 was repurposed as an event venue especially targeted at hosting conferences, banquets, fashion shows and others.

In September 2024 PpW announced in a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1045206820943043&set=a.499910772139320) that Mińska&nbsp;65 would host their big show - [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md).

### Location 

Mińska&nbsp;65 is located in Praga Północ disctrict in Warsaw, at its eastern-bank side of the Vistula river. It is located near the district office of Praga Północ. The venue is rather well-conntected to the rest of the city, with both bus and tram stops within walking distance, as well as to the Warszawa Wschodnia (_Warsaw East_) train station. Public transport route from "Centrum" takes about 20-25 minutes. The venue itself is also adapted to host a medium-sized car park for the attending guests.

### Venue

The first event hosted by Mińska&nbsp;65 was held in one of three available halls called "Sala Kolumnowa" (_Pillared Hall_). Its area is about 880 square meters and in its raw condition the hall is able to accommodate around 800 standing spectators. The distinguishing feature of this hall are large skylights which give the place a unique atmosphere. At Co Za Noc the size of the hall allowed to dedicate a huge part of the hall to catering, merch stands and a tattoo parlour. Another hall used by PpW for some of their events is "Hala Labo" (_Labo Hall_), located in a separate, adjacent building.
