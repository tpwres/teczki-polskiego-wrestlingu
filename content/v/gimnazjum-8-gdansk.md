Gimnazjum no. 8 was a middle school located in Gdańsk, in the Stare Przedmieście district. Initially a Primary School no. 67, opened in 1962, it was replaced by Gimnazjum no. 8 in 2009. After the 2017 education reform middle schools were disbanded, causing the closure of Gimnazjum no. 8 and the return of Primary School no. 67.

The school saw three late shows by [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) and three early ones by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).
