Klub Pod Palmą (_Palm Tree Club_) is a music club in Rzeszów, commonly used to hold concerts by various Polish music acts.

Between 2012 and 2014 Por Palmą was the main venue where [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) held their shows. Following the disappointingly low turn-up at [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md) the promotion made the decision to relocate to Gdańsk, however two more shows were still held at the club before the move was made.
