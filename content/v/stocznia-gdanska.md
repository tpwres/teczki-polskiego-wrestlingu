Stocznia Gdańska (_Gdańsk Shipyard_) is a historical post-industrial complex in the city of Gdańsk, located on the western shore of the Martwa Wisła river.

The city's ship-building history dates back to the late 15th century, with the Shipyard itself being officially opened in 1947 by combining the neighbouring Shipyard No. (formerly _Danziger Werft_, or Stocznia Gdańska) 1 and Shipyard No. 2 (formerly Stocznia Schichaua). In 1967 the complex was renamed to "Stocznia Gdańska im. Lenina" (_Vladimir Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk_), a name that remained in use until 1989, which marked the fall of communism in the Eastern Bloc and the beginning of the socio-economic transformation of Poland.

Over the course of 1990s - 2020s the Shipyard underwent a number of changes to its name as well as the business model, from a joint-stock company to a private limited company. In 2021 Stocznia Gdańsk&nbsp;S.A. (_JSC_) was bought out by Stocznia Gdańska sp.&nbsp;z&nbsp;o.o. (_Ltd._), and the southern section of the complex was retired and turned into a cultural centre. Among other undertakings, this included turning the historical [BHP Hall][sala-bhp], where the [August Agreements][porozumienia-sierpniowe] were signed, into a museum of [Solidarity][solidarnosc], and erecting the [European Solidarity Centre][ecs].

Beginning with the early years of the 21st century, locations across the post-industrial complex hosted a variety of concerts and cultural events. These include [VHS Hell][vhs-hell], a double screening of B&nbsp;films: one played from a VHS tape and the other narrated live by a person making up the dialogues on the fly; [Octopus Film Festival][octopus], specialising in genre films, both all-time classics such as [Blade Runner][blade-runner] or [Stalker][stalker], but also exploitation cinema such as [Creepozoids][creepozoids] or [Nude on the Moon][nude-on-the-moon]; Szlamfest, a self-described celebration of low culture; or [Mystic Festival][mystic], a four-day set of heavy metal concerts. Over the years there were also standalone concerts by the likes of [Jean-Michel Jarre][jan-michal-gorac], [David Gilmour][dawid-gilmurski] of Pink Floyd, [Marillion][marillion], [KULT][kult], [Lordi][lordi], [Cradle of Filth][kredki], [Sick N' Beautiful][snb] or [Wednesday 13][sroda-13].

Eventually, Polish wrestling also found its way to the Shipyard, starting with [KPW Szlamfest](@/e/kpw/2017-02-04-kpw-szlamfest.md) in 2017, which was a part of the aforementioned Szlamfest festival. It was followed by [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9.md) and [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md), also accompanying the same event. Years later, in 2025, PpW would feature their [showcase](@/e/ppw/2025-05-16-ppw-lucha-libre-extravaganza.md) at the [Tequila Mezcal Festival][tequila], and soon after that they'd return with a [two-day show](@/e/ppw/2025-06-05-ppw-mystic-festival.md) at that year's Mystic Festival.
