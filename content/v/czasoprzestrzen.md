Czasoprzestrzeń (_Spacetime_) is a community center, art and cultural center, and event venue in Wrocław. It occupies the halls of a former tram yard, and has been host to both [MZW's](@/o/mzw.md) and [PTW's](@/o/ptw.md) events. The halls have a unique industrial character, very high ceilings and massive wooden doors to the outside.

## Location

The venue is located at Tramwajowa street 1-3, in Wrocław's district of Dąbie. It's very close to both Wrocław's famous zoo, and Hala Stulecia (_Centennial Hall_). The Technical University also has several of its dormitories nearby. It is easily reached by tram and bus from anywhere in the city.
