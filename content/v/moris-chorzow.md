MORIS - short for Miejski Ośrodek Rekreacji i Sportu, _Municipal Center for Recreation and Sports_ - is the municipal authority overseeing sport facilities in Chorzów, and also the name of their biggest building, a multipurpose sports hall. It has a capacity of up to 1500 spectators with floor seating. The hall's history includes European-level volleyball, handball, boxing and MMA events, judo, karate, dance competitions and many other events. It is also used as training facility for several local sports clubs, mainly playing volleyball and futsal.

This venue hosted the first two major events by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md),
in [2021](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) and [2022](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md).
Cagematch also listed it as the location for all PTW Underground events in 2022 and 2023. This is incorrect - these events were held at [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md), also in Chorzów but about 15 minutes away by car, or 40 by public transport. This mistake has since been rectified.
