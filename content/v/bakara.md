Bakara is a local community center located in Wrocław's Grabiszyn district. It's next to the footbal stadium used by the city's team, although the two places are separated by a railway line.
It is named after a certain variety of the rose - the Black Baccara, which has a distinctive dark burgundy color.
Bakara was built in the 1970s by the same housing cooperative that built the surrounding housing complexes, and later expanded and remodeled in 2009. During these works, a large theater hosting up to 150 seats was created.

It is that space that hosted [MZW](@/o/mzw.md)'s events between 2017 and 2020. Later, wrestling events moved to [Czasoprzestrzeń](@/v/czasoprzestrzen.md).
The venue hosts many kinds of events, from folk music concerts, improv theatre workshops, art exhibitions to language and dance classes for seniors.
