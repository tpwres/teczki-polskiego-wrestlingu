2KOŁA (_2WHEELS_) is a motorcycle bar and event venue in Warsaw. It's the first venue to host events by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md).

The bar opened in 1998. It is dedicated to biker culture, and decorated in an American biker bar style. A prominent feature is the wall of death: a wooden, curved wall with a horizontally mounted motorcycle, replicating this classic sideshow attraction. Below this wall is a small stage, often used for music performances, chiefly - but not exclusively - rock, hard rock and metal.

## Location

The venue is located at Tunelowa 2, along the curve of a service road on the north side of Warszawa Zachodnia (_Warsaw West_) railway station. The area is considered part of Warsaw's Wola district, in the Czyste neighbourhood. The station's proximity offers good transport interchanges from everywhere in Warsaw and surrounding metropolitan area.
