Szafirowy Dwór, formerly called Pod Platanem, is a hotel & restaurant located in Kozłów, owned by [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md). After holding their Underground shows in the [Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md) for two years, PTW moved to Kozłów starting with [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md).

On August 15, 2024, Okoński posted a sneak peek of the revamped PTW arena on his Instagram profile. The venue is divided in two by a set of curtains. Workout equipment can be found in one section, while the other features a wrestling ring, a number of tables and wall decorations depicting major PTW characters like [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md), [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) and Baba-Thunder.
