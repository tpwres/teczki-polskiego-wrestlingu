"Zmowa" (_The Collusion_) is a villainous professional wrestling stable that performs mainly in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), while making sporadic apperances in other Polish promotions such as [MZW](@/o/mzw.md). The group's name came from [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), who started using it during his feud with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), PpW's booker and promotor, and his allies.

## History

The beggining of "Zmowa" dates back to late 2023 / early 2024, when the villainous PpW's producer Mister Z formed an alliance with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and Jakub Linde, Gustav's enforcer. Later on [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) began cooperating with the group. Legia Łysych joined "Zmowa" shortly after their debut at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) where they defeated Pure Gold. In mid-2024 [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) joined "Zmowa" as their ultraviolent specialist.

It became clear that "Zmowa" aims for a total domination in every division of PpW, working together to achieve their goals by supporting each other in matches against their opponents. They become enemies with almost all of the remaining PpW roster, including [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), Pure Gold ([Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) & [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)), [Samson](@/w/samson.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md).

After an intense confrontation at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md), Biesiad announced the formation of an impromptu alliance of babyfaces called "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie" (_The Collusion Against The Collusion_) and challenged "Zmowa" for a tag team match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md).
