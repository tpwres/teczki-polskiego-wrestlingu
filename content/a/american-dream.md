Amerykański Sen (_American Dream_) is a short documentary film from 2017. The film was directed by Marek Skrzecz, produced and released by Studio Munka.

It tells the story of [Szymon](@/w/szymon-siwiec.md) who lives in a sleepy small town in southern Poland. After seeing [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) wrestlers perform at a community festival, he dreams of becoming one himself. Ultimately, he succeeds after facing the hardships of training, thus fulfilling his American Dream.

The first wrestling show portrayed is [MZW in Smolec](@/e/mzw/2014-06-21-mzw-untitled.md) on 21 June 2014. Briefly shown are German wrestlers Rick Baxxter, Franz Engel (ZERO), Robert Kaiser; British wrestler Kevin Williams; and MZW's own Kowboj Luke, [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md).

In the second act, Szymon travels to [Niedźwiedzica][niedzwiedzica-enwiki], where he enrolls in Jędruś's wrestling school with several other adepts, who, however, remain unnamed. The second show we see, where Szymon takes part in a battle royal, is his debut for the promotion at [Wakacyjny Slam](@/e/mzw/2014-08-30-mzw-wakacyjny-slam.md) on the 30th of August of the same year.

The ending sees Szymon posing in his ring attire for a photo session, and a poster for [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md) featuring one of these photos is the final shot.

The film was featured on various documentary film festivals, mostly in Poland, and won a number of awards. It is likely the only such documentary about the Polish wrestling scene.
