Below is the general chronology of Polish wrestling promotions, both professional and backyard.
<!-- more -->
Since the available sources vary in their quality and accuracy, many of the start/end dates are approximations or even guesswork, particularly in the case of various backyards. Thus, this is meant as a general guideline rather than a definitive listing. Note also, that the list of backyards is most likely incomplete, as it's nearly impossible to find every amateur group that has ever existed, nor even to ascertain their number.
