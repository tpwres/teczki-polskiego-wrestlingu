Throughout the history of the Polish wrestling there have been a number of promotions, both professional and backyard. This is a timeline showing most of the known ones.
<!-- more -->
Since the available sources vary in their quality and accuracy, many of the start/end dates are approximations or even guesswork, particularly in the case of various backyards. Thus, this is meant as a general guideline rather than a definitive listing. Note also, that the list of backyards is most likely incomplete, as it's nearly impossible to find every amateur group that has ever existed, nor even to ascertain their number.
