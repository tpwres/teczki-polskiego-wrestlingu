"Zieloni" (_The Greens_) is a the name for a group of Polish wrestlers, who were originally connected to [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) or started their career there.
However, not all MZW wrestlers are Greens.
The group was started by wrestlers who joined in 2017/2018, and created a strongly bonded social group, connected by their wrestling endeavors.
Thus, wrestlers like [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) or [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) also started their training in MZW, or [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) who created the organization, are not considered to be Greens.

### Influence

The Greens, aside from being a friends group, were also one of the factions in [Prime Time Wrestling's](@/o/ptw.md) locker room.
The other factions were "Originals" (who started in PTW) and "Blues" (ex-[KPW](@/o/kpw.md)).
Sometimes, internal tensions in the organization were caused by differences between these groups, and the management.
Mainly caused by differences in their approach to quality and wrestling philosophy.
For example: Justin Joy's harsh training regime.

The group can be compared to the famous Kliq, active in WWE in the mid-1990s. The Greens were most active and influential in PTW since 2021, but also in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) since 2023.
