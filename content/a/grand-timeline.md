{% timeline() %}
#### 1800s

* The precursor to modern wrestling came from circuses, carnivals and sometimes theatres. As part of the show, athletes wrestle each other in single-match events, usually under their real names.
* Oldest known wrestling show in modern-day Poland, held in Łódź on February 9, 1895.

#### Before 1918

* Matches usually pit representatives of different countries fighting each other for supremacy. The fights almost always end in the local champion winning against a foreign opponent, draws and losses are rare.
* The undefeated Jakob Koch is finally bested by Stanisław Zbyszko. A match between Albert Sturm and Zbyszko ends with a disqualification, the first such case on record.
* Stanisław and Władysław, his real life brother, travel to USA, where both will achieve some successes in wrestling.
* Events are held mostly in Szczecin, Wrocław, Bytom, Toruń and Poznań, with a number of other cities getting some shows as well.

#### Inter-war period

* Only two known events held, in Wrocław and Warsaw. Stanisław Zbyszko returns to Poland, writes autobiography.
* First known wrestler to fight under a ring name instead of his real name: Cyklop.

#### Post-Word War II

* Poland is somewhat successful in combat sports, winning olympic medals in boxing, judo and classical wrestling, however no pro wrestling events are known to be held in this period.

#### 1974

* Andrzej Supron travels to USA, discovers pro wrestling on TV. Later meets Killer Kowalski and Ivan Putski, two wrestlers of Polish origin. Putski convinces Supron to try and start presenting pro wrestling in Poland.

#### 1980s

* Supron wins silver medal in classical wrestling in the Moscow Olympics of 1980.
Later, assembles a team of athletes, trains them (despite having no pro wrestling training himself), and stages a couple of events in Warsaw and Poznań.

#### 1993

* Supron contacts a wrestler group touring Europe at the time, and manages to draw them to Poland for a single show. [World Wrestling Superstars](@/e/wws/1993-12-14-wws-world-wrestling-superstars.md) is held in Warsaw, with names like Bob Orton, The Iron Sheik, Koko B. Ware and Greg Valentine on the card.

#### 1999

* Paweł Borkowski contacts Supron, wanting to create the first fully professional Polish pro-wrestling promotion. They create PPWF (Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation), which only manages to hold training sessions, but no shows due to lack of interest.
* Andrzej Supron buys a ring for PPWF.

#### 2005

* With pro wrestling still non-existent, a backyard scene begins to emerge. The earliest known backyards are Pomerania Indy Wrestling Group from Gdańsk, and Polish Wrestling Underground. Many of these organizations fold after a year or two, but some thrive. The timeline graph in [Chronology of Polish wrestling](@/a/chronology.md) includes these backyards.

#### 2006

* Borkowski plans to create a wrestling school, using Supron's ring. It is discovered to be too costly to repair, and the idea is abandoned.

#### 2009

* [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md), an American wrestler, settles in Poland in the mid-2000s. Discovering the non-existent state of pro-wrestling in the country, he opens [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), importing a proper ring and training rookies. Some of these rookies come from backyards.
* [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) joins Do Or Die Wrestling, hones his promo skills, becomes a heel manager character.
* Roid also contacts Supron and Borkowski, quickly gaining their support. However, the organization struggles with selling tickets and gaining the public's attention. Despite that, they hold three small events in Warsaw. One of their wrestlers is Marcin Michalski who will soon take on the gimmick of [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md).

#### 2010

* Borkowski and Supron end their relation with DDW, and start [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md), holding two well-received shows with talent from major European organizations at the time, in [Radom](@/e/tbw/2010-02-27-tbw-1.md) and [Zawiercie](@/e/tbw/2010-06-05-tbw-2.md).

* PXW, the backyard from Głuchołazy, folds.

#### 2014

* The former Straceniec, now known as [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), along with Jędruś Bułecka, purchase a professional wrestling ring and create [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). They hold shows in Głuchołazy and various small towns in the region.

* COVID-19 hits, lockdown ensues, and **all wrestling is cancelled** for more than a year.
* Pawłowski announces a new organization, entices many wrestlers to join it, draining the rosters of both MZW and KPW. Due to lockdowns, however, their first show is postponed.

* PTW holds their [fourth major show](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) in Wrocław in June, in [Czasoprzestrzeń](@/v/czasoprzestrzen.md) - the same venue as MZW. The difference in budget and production value, as compared to the rather minimal and utilitarian MZW, is stark.
* In September, MZW and PpW hold a [co-branded show](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md) in Wrocław, in the exact same venue, making history as the first such act of collaboration in Poland.

* PTW holds their [infamous lottery](@/o/ptw.md#the-lottery). This marketing stunt ultimately backfires, losing the organization money. Many of their talent, [fed up and conflicted](@/a/ptw-crisis.md) with the organization, [leave](@/a/ptw-exits.md).
* As a result, PTW downscales heavily, both in roster size and ambitions, relocates to Kozłów. The Underground series loses its monthly routine.
* PpW opens their training facility to the public, dubbed [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md). They hold a summer camp, with initial trainer being [Jacob Crane](@w/jacob-crane.md), later replaced by [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) after former's departure to Japan.
* After exiting PTW, a group of their former backstage crew and talent starts [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md). The group soon announces their [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) to be held in December. For the first time ever, [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) lends their workers ([Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) and [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md)) to another Polish organization, making this the first Polish card featuring representation from KPW, MZW and PpW, as well as some ex-PTW free agents. The show was dubbed by some as "Polish Forbidden Door".
