#### 1800s

* The precursor to modern wrestling came from circuses, carnivals and sometimes theatres. As part of the show, athletes wrestle each other in single-match events, usually under their real names.
* Oldest known wrestling show in modern-day Poland, held in Łódź on February 9, 1895.

#### Before 1918

* Matches usually pit representatives of different countries fighting each other for supremacy. The fights almost always end in the local champion winning against a foreign opponent, draws and losses are rare.
* The undefeated Jakob Koch is finally bested by Stanisław Zbyszko. A match between Albert Sturm and Zbyszko ends with a disqualification, the first such case on record.
* Stanisław and Władysław, his real life brother, travel to USA, where both will achieve some successes in wrestling.
* Events are held mostly in Szczecin, Wrocław, Bytom, Toruń and Poznań, with a number of other cities getting some shows as well.

#### Inter-war period

* Only two known events held, in Wrocław and Warsaw. Stanisław Zbyszko returns to Poland, writes autobiography.
* First known wrestler to fight under a ring name instead of his real name: Cyklop.

#### Post-Word War II

* Poland is somewhat successful in combat sports, winning olympic medals in boxing, judo and classical wrestling, however no pro wrestling events are known to be held in this period.

[World Wrestling Superstars](@/e/wws/1993-12-14-wws-world-wrestling-superstars.md) is held in Warsaw, with names like Bob Orton, The Iron Sheik, Koko B. Ware and Greg Valentine on the card.

#### 1999

* Paweł Borkowski contacts Supron, wanting to create the first fully professional Polish pro-wrestling promotion. This would become PPWF (Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation), and although it held training sessions and owned a professional ring, never held any shows.

#### 2005

* With pro wrestling still non-existent, a backyard scene begins to emerge. The earliest known backyards are Pomerania Indy Wrestling Group from Gdańsk, and Polish Wrestling Underground. Many of these organizations fold after a year or two, but some thrive. See the timeline in [Chronology of Polish wrestling](@/a/chronology.md).

#### 2009

* [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md), an American wrestler, settles in Poland in the mid-2000s. Discovering the non-existent state of pro-wrestling in the country, he opens [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), importing a proper ring and training rookies. Some of these rookies come from backyards.
* [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) joins Do Or Die Wrestling, hones his promo skills, becomes a manager character.
* Roid also contacts Supron and Borkowski, quickly gaining their support. However, the organization struggles with selling tickets and gaining the public's attention.
