At the end of 2024, [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) introduced a sponsorship deal with a Warsaw shooting range, PM Shooter. Unlike PpW's usual partners, the brand quickly got involved in storylines, with the shooting range crew presented as a band of mercenaries, aiming to end [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) at [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md)'s behest.

## The story

### Initial stages (December 2024 - March 2025)

On the 19th of December 2024, [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) announced their partnership with PM Shooter, a Warsaw shooting range. They teased some further surprises, which turned out to be a special discount for the range, earned by showing a PpW ticket.

Beginning with [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), PpW started to incorporate the PM Shooter logo into event posters and branding.

### Incorporation into storylines

On March 4th, PpW uploaded a video in which Mister Z incapacitates [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) in his real-life workplace and PpW arena - [2KOŁA](@/v/2kola.md). Blade is seen hanging with his legs tied to the ceiling, when Biesiad barges in and saves him. Blade reports that Z went shooting - with Biesiad quickly realising he went to PM Shooter range, and giving chase.

On March 5th, PpW uploaded a video of Biesiad and Mister Z being involved in a shootout at the range. First, Mister Z practices by shooting at cardboard targets with a photo of Biesiad on them. Biesiad appears, wearing  a leather jacket and ammunition belts across his chest (a look resembling a stereotypical '80s action star), and opens fire directly at Z. After the two exchange shots, Biesiad gets the upper hand and Mister Z escapes in a pickup truck. Frustrated, Biesiad throws his gun to the ground, and the camera pans to the shooting range building, with a large PM Shooter neon above the entrance.

Those events, though seemingly a promotional stunt, were quickly recognized as canon by PpW and resulted in the announcement of Johnny Blade vs Mister Z for [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) as a punishment for Biesiad's "attempted murder" on Z.

### Arrest angle

At Teraz Albo Nigdy, Mister Z revealed that the court granted him a restraining order and now Biesiad is not allowed to come near him. After Biesiad got eliminated from the _20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match_, he continued to brawl with Mister Z until a band of uniformed henchmen, carrying rifles and wearing PM Shooter colors, captured Biesiad and escorted him outside the venue. It was later revealed that at a future show, [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), Biesiad would face a "serviceman" to regain his freedom. [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) provided a follow-up on the angle, announcing Biesiad for a five-way match at [Legacy vol. 2](content/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), with a caveat that Biesiad might not make it due to his arrest.

The storyline continued with Biesiad's Instagram account taken over (in kayfabe) by PM Shooter, and all the posts and stories on it written from their point of view. Via Insta-stories, they announced that Biesiad was granted a leave for the Legacy show.

Biesiad made his entrance handcuffed and shackled, and escorted to the ring by two members of the PM Shooter team, continuing the storyline. Towards the end of the match, Biesiad briefly exited the ring only to be brutally captured by the PM Shooter mercenaries again, who handcuffed and escorted him outside the venue. It seems like his leave from PM Shooter's confinement was only temporary.

On 13.04 PpW posted a video of Biesiad held in custody and tortured by PM Shooter mercenaries. It was followed up the next day with a video of Jonny Blade infiltrating the PM Shooter complex. He frees Biesiad and they try to run away. Just when they are about to jump the fence, Blade gets shot. Biesiad is taken back into custody, while the mercenaries dig a grave to bury the wounded Blade. Not long after that Biesiad's phone was found by [Red Floorfiller](@/w/biesiad.md), who continued to post content via Insta-stories - a callback to PpW's backyard lore.

On 22.04.2025 PpW posted yet another video in the PM Shooter saga. In this one, Mister Z can be seen honoring his deal with the PM Shooter mercenaries. He pays them in Peruvian artifacts, and offers additional bounty in the form of the talisman of King Cápac if they finish Biesiad once and for all. This would mean humiliating him in the ring by sending the strongest mercenary to beat him. Mr Z would be the special referee.

### Fight for freedom

On 23.04.2025 PpW announced that at [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) Biesiad Strong would face Scandinavian wrestler Mr Power Up (PM Shooter's kayfabe hired gun), and that the match would be officiated by Mister Z as the Special Guest Referee.

Once again, Biesiad made his entrance chained and escorted by the PM Shooter crew. With both competitors getting hyped up for the upcoming fight, a recap of Biesiad's escape attempt and Mister Z's deals was shown on the venue's big screen. The PM Shooter crew remained at ringside. Mister Z as referee played favorites for Mr Power Up, ignoring his obvious breaking of the rules. Against all odds Biesiad won the match, despite Mister Z's best efforts to count slowly.

Post-match, one of the PM Shooter members - apparently the leader - voiced his frustration with Mr Power Up's performance and demanded compensation for the job. Mister Z said that due to the job's failure the deal was off and they wouldn't get the amulet. The PM Shooter leader reminds Z that they would get their compensation one way or the other. They surrounded the ring and attacked Mister Z, while Biesiad suddenly made the save. The two bitter opponents fought side by side just for a minute as crowd chanted "Power of friendship". Coming from each side of the ring, they suddenly bumped their backs and realized what'd just happened. They quickly broke contact and faced off. Biesiad grabbed the mic and gave Z an ultimatum - either he gives Biesiad a match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](content/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md), or gets beaten up there and then. Mister Z begrudgingly accepted and gave Biesiad the choice of stipulation, immediately announced as a "Cieśla Match" (_Carpenter Match_).

### Johnny's fate

After the show, as [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) was about to deliver his parting words, the lights suddenly went out. The big screen showed a video package of necromantic rituals and a witch-like figure chanting "ćibaz Akainorbod" (_kill Dobroniak_, backwards), resulting in Johnny Blade rising from the grave. The lights came back on revealing Johnny Blade standing in the ring, looking like a zombie. He picked up the mic and called out [Stanisław van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md), seemingly challenging him for a match. At Ledwo Legalne 5, Dobroniak won the Undead Beerbath Match by bathing Zombie Blade in non-alcoholic beer, which allowed him to exorcise the zombie and save Johnny Blade.

### Aftermath

In the interviews at [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), Biesiad and Mister Z declared truce to finish up their PM Shooter problem. However, this was not followed up in the build to [Ledwo Legalne 5](content/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) and the story was seemingly quietly finished.
