## History

The title was created at [PTW#3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) in November 2022, by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) - PTW's owner and General Manager.
Along with the title, Pawłowski announced a 20-person Gold Rush Rumble match (a variation of a Battle Royal match), which took place in February 2024 during [PTW#5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md).
The match was won by Dawid "Puncher" Seńko, who then became the inaugural PTW Champion.

## Belt design

The championship belt design is inspired by WWE's World Heavyweight Championship, both the modern variation, and the classic Big Gold Belt dating back to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA).
Like the historic Big Gold Belt, the title has three large black and gold plates on a black leather strap.
All three plates include gold filigree, and each plate is outlined with a rope trim to represent the three ropes of a wrestling ring.
The central plate shows a large globe, with a black rim and "Prime Time Wrestling" and "Champion" engravings. Next to it, on both sides, are engravings of a wrestling ring.
