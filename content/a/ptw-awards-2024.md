This is the second edition of the PTW End-of-the-Year Awards.

<!-- more -->

PTW Awards 2024 is a follow-up to the [2022 edition](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md), as the 2023 one didn't take place. 

Like previously, the winners are decided by fans on the official PTW Facebook fanpage by voting with FB reactions for the nominees. The voting started in mid-December 2024 and is set to comprise ten categories.

On 30.12.2024 fans noticed a sudden influx of votes for Spartan in the "Wrestler of the Year" and "Hero of the Year" categories. Just like in 2022, those votes came from Vietnamese accounts.

## Categories awarded

- Wrestler Roku (_Wrestler of the Year_)
- Debiutant Roku (_Newcomer of the Year_)
- Progres Roku (_Progress of the Year_)
- Mówca Roku (_Speaker of the Year_)
- Bohater Roku (_Hero of the Year_)
- Złoczyńca Roku (_Villain of the Year_)
