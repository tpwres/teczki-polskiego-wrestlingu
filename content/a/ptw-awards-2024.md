This is the second edition of the PTW End-of-the-Year Awards.

<!-- more -->

PTW Awards 2024 were a follow-up to the [2022 edition](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md), as the 2023 one didn't take place. 

Like previously, the winners were to be decided by fans on the official PTW Facebook fanpage by voting with FB reactions for the nominees. The voting started in mid-December 2024 and was set to comprise ten categories.

On 30.12.2024 fans noticed a sudden influx of votes for Spartan in the "Wrestler of the Year" and "Hero of the Year" categories. Just like in 2022, those votes came from Vietnamese accounts.

Although initially presented as a genuine fan-voted popularity contest, the 2024 PTW Awards turned out to be a worked angle. Only two Awards were actually given out at a show. At [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) cut a promo on [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) accusing him of buying votes (a repetition of the "Asian Scandal" from 2022). Arkadiusz Pawłowski announced himself the Speaker of the Year winner (online, from a private Facebook account), and overruled fan votes, allowing Łukasz Okoński to award Vincent Caravaggio Newcomer of the Year, despite [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) having the majority. [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) was awarded in two categories, Hero and Progres of the Year.

PTW then seemingly dropped the angle, as the Awards were not mentioned again.

## Categories

The [initial post][10-categories] stated fans could vote in ten categories, but only six were announced and voted for:

- Wrestler Roku (_Wrestler of the Year_)
- Debiutant Roku (_Newcomer of the Year_)
- Progres Roku (_Progress of the Year_)
- Mówca Roku (_Speaker of the Year_)
- Bohater Roku (_Hero of the Year_)
- Złoczyńca Roku (_Villain of the Year_)
