Translations and explanations are provided, but no attempt at transliteration was made.

## General expletives

* _Wypierdalaj!_ - Get the Fuck Out: often used to react to heels and other unwelcome characters
* _Chuj ci w dupę!_: Up Your Arse, popular and general use expletive referring to anal sex.
* _Kurwy i śmiecie, z [X] nie wyjedziecie_: Motherfuckers, you ain't gonna leave town [X] alive. Used against heels, especially billed from out of town.
* _[X] a gdzie to kurwa jest?_: [X] where the fuck is that; used to insult a heel's hometown. Sometimes padded with extra words to match the rhythm. For [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md)'s town of Bartoszyce no padding is needed, but for [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md)'s Poznań the chant starts with "Miasto Poznań".
* _Chuj ci na imię, hej [X] chuj ci na imię_ - roughly equivalent to the British "[X] is a wanker" chant, although the expletive is stronger.

## Calls to action

* _Chcemy Krwi_ - We Want Blood: crowd wanting someone to start bleeding.
* _Przemoc!_ - Violence: encouraging the same.
* _Zabij Go!_ - Kill Him: encouraging offense.
* _Zajeb Go!_ - Fuck Him Up: also encouraging offensive action.
* _Zjedz Mu Łeb!_ - Eat His Head: same. Once actually acted upon by [Samson](@/w/samson.md) who bit his opponent on the head to great pop.
* _Urwij Mu Łeb!_ - Rip His Head Off: generally encouraging violence.
* _Zostaw [X], ty kurwo_ zostaw [X]: Leave [X] alone, when a babyface receives too much punishment.
* _Jedziesz z tą kurwą, hej [X] jedziesz z tą kurwą_: Fuck him up [X], encouraging offense and insulting the opponent at the same time.
* _Pokaż dupę!_ - Show Your Ass. Against male performers it's rather a _What_ chant signifying the persona is boring.
* _Trzecia Lina!_ - Third Rope: calling for a wrestler to perform a top-rope move.

## Referee

* _Sędzia Chuj_ - Referee is a Dick: after referee fails to see heel tactics, or a three-count that was not to the crowd's satisfaction. Referee [Krystian Czekaj](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md) put it on a T-Shirt.
* _Sędzia Super_ - Referee is Awesome; counter-chant to the above, but also when ref prevents further damage or throws a heel out.
* _Było Trzy_ - It was Three; when a heel kicks out at the last microsecond.

## Weapons

* _Więcej krzeseł!_ - Bring More Chairs, when the current number is not enough.

## Songs

* _Panie, któryś stanął nad brzegiem_: this is [Barka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord,_You_Have_Come_to_the_Lakeshore), a religious song that was especially liked by Polish Pope John Paul II. Sometimes fans start to randomly sing it at 21:37, the exact hour of the pope's death. It's not in the Pope's memory though, but rather the opposite - mocking his cult deeply enshrined in Polish Catholicism.
  Sometimes also sang for [Greg](@/w/greg.md) of [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in his Pope of Polish Wrestling gimmick - which he seemed to enjoy.

## Wrestler-specific

* _Mister Zjeb_ - [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), where _zjeb_ is retard or loser.
* _Papież Polak_ - Polish Pope: [Greg](@/w/greg.md), as described under Songs above
* _Siła Przyjaźni_ - Power of Friendship: [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md), referencing his early gimmick in [PTW](@/o/ptw.md)
