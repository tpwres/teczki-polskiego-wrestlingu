Translations and explanations are provided, but no attempt at transliteration was made.

## General expletives

* _Wypierdalaj!_ - "Get the fuck out": often used to react to heels and other unwelcome characters.
* _Chuj ci w dupę!_ - "Up your arse": popular and general use expletive referring to anal sex.
* _Kurwy i śmiecie, z [X] nie wyjedziecie_ - "Motherfuckers, you ain't gonna leave [town X] alive": used against heels, especially billed from out of town.
* _[X], a gdzie to kurwa jest?_ - "[Town X], where the fuck is that?": used to insult a heel's hometown. \
  Sometimes padded with extra words to match the rhythm. For [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md)'s town of Bartoszyce no padding is needed, but for [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md)'s Poznań the chant starts with _Miasto Poznań_ ("Poznań city").
* _Chuj ci na imię, hej [X], chuj ci na imię_ - roughly equivalent to the British "[X] is a wanker" chant, although the expletive is stronger (lit. "Dick's your name").

## Praise

* _Zajebiste!_ - "This is awesome", although more expletive.
* _[X] jest zajebisty_ - "[X] is awesome": most often to the tune of "Seven Nation Army".

## Calls to action

* _Chcemy Krwi!_ - "We want blood!": the crowd wants someone to start bleeding.
* _Przemoc!_ - "Violence!": encouraging the same.
* _Zabij Go!_ - "Kill him!": encouraging offense.
* _Zajeb Go!_ - "Fuck him up": also encouraging offensive action.
* _Zjedz Mu Łeb!_ - "Eat his head!": same. Once actually acted upon by [Samson](@/w/samson.md) who [bit his opponent on the head](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) to a great pop.
* _Urwij Mu Łeb!_ - "Rip his head off": generally encouraging violence.
* _Zostaw [X], ty kurwo_ zostaw [X] - "Leave [X] alone, you whore": when a babyface receives too much punishment. \
  At [Godzina Zero 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md), during [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) vs Reece Alexios, a slightly modified version was heard, replacing the expletive with Alexios's nationality: _ty Greku zostaw Leona_ - "leave Leon alone, you Greek".
* _Jedziesz z tą kurwą, hej [X], jedziesz z tą kurwą_ - "Fuck this whore up, [X]", encouraging offense and insulting the opponent at the same time.
* _Pokaż dupę!_ - "Show your ass": against a male performers it's rather a _What_ chant signifying the persona is boring.
* _Trzecia Lina!_ - "Third rope": calling for a wrestler to perform a top-rope move.

## Referee

* _Sędzia chuj!_ - "Referee is a dick": after referee fails to see heel tactics, or a three-count that was not to the crowd's satisfaction. Referee [Krystian Czekaj](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md) put it on a T-shirt.
* _Sędzia super_ - "Referee is awesome": counter-chant to the above, but also when ref prevents further damage or throws a heel out.
* _Było trzy_ - "It was three": when a heel kicks out at the last microsecond.

## Weapons

* _Więcej krzeseł!_ - "Bring more chairs": when the current number is not enough.

## Intros

* _Kim ty jesteś?_ - "Who are you": the crowd is unfamiliar with the character (or pretends not to be).
* _MAŁO!_ - "Not enough": a response to the ring announcer calling a wrestler's weight. Somewhat equivalent to repeating "One Fall!" after the announcer. \
  Popularized by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) in KPW and later PTW, the typical dialogue is:
  - Announcer: _Pochodzący z [X], ważący [Y] kilogramów_ ("Hailing from [X], weighing in at [Y] kilograms.")
  - Crowd: _MAŁO!_ (rarely _DUŻO!_, meaning "A lot", when a wrestler is especially massive.)

## Songs

* _Panie, któryś stanął nad brzegiem_: this is [Barka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord,_You_Have_Come_to_the_Lakeshore), a religious song that was especially liked by the Polish Pope John Paul II. Fans may start to randomly sing it at 21:37 (9:37&nbsp;PM), the exact hour of his death. It is not in the Pope's memory, however, but rather the opposite - mocking his cult deeply enshrined in Polish Catholicism.
  Sometimes also sang for [Greg](@/w/greg.md) of [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in his Pope of Polish Wrestling gimmick - which he seemed to enjoy.
* _Mam tak samo jak ty_: Czesław Niemen's [Sen o Warszawie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePNUSmH3dMI), sometimes sang before [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) shows start.

## Wrestler-specific

* _Mister Zjeb_ - [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md): _zjeb_ means "retard" or "loser".
* _Papież Polak_ - "Polish Pope": [Greg](@/w/greg.md), as described under Songs above.
* _Polski lis_ - "Polish fox": [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md).
* _Wiedźmin 4_ - "Witcher 4": [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), referring to his attire and gimmick of a Slavic warrior.
* _Facet w gaciach_ - "Guy in undies": [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) and his usual ring attire.
* _Siła przyjaźni_ - "Power of friendship": [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md), referencing his early gimmick in [PTW](@/o/ptw.md).
* _Bóg jest łysy_ - "God is bald": [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md)'s signature bald head. Also _Bóg ma wąsa_ - "God has a 'stache", when he grew one.
* _Sadzić! Palić! Zalegalizować!_ - "Plant it, smoke it, legalize it": a pro-marijuana chant. Used against [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md), who was straight-edge.
* _Chuj w dupę Łodzi, tej kurwie nic nie zaszkodzi_ - "Up the arse of Łódź, the whore's ain't gonna mind": insulting Łódź, a city in central Poland and the hometown of [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). A stadium chant against their football clubs.
* _Legia to stara kurwa_ - "Legia is an old whore": a stadium chant against football club Legia Warszawa, and by extension, the team of Legia Łysych: [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md).
