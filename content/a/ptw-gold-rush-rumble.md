## Concept

Gold Rush Rumble match closely resembles Royal Rumble made famous by [World Wrestling Entertaiment](@/o/wwe.md). The match begins with two wrestlers in the ring, with the remaining contenders entering the ring at timed, although often irregular, intervals (around 1:30 minutes, but it may vary). The match traditionally involves 20 wrestlers. The original twist in the first edition of the Gold Rush Rumble was to turn the match into an Elimination Fatal Four Way Match, with wins being allowed only by pinfall or submission instead of throwing an oponent above the top rope. This idea was seemingly scrapped during the second edition, as the rules of the Gold Rush Rumble remained the same until the end of the match.

## Prize 

As of 2025, the main prize of the Gold Rush Rumble varies. For first edition of the Rumble, the winner was crowned as the inaugural [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md) while at the second edition the winner of the match was awarded the #1 Contender spot for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), PTW's secondary title.
