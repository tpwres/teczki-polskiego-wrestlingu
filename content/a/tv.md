Polish wrestling has only very recently gained any media attention and coverage. It has never been very popular
in Poland, and rarely featured on TV.

## 1990s-2002

TNT, an American TV channel that mainly focused on classic films, reached Poland in the late 1990, becoming available in several cable TV networks. Initially sharing its programming with Cartoon Network, which ran from the morning hours until 22:00 (10PM), which is when TNT content started airing.

TNT aired World Championship Wrestling's Nitro flagship show, later joined by Thunder (the B-show) directly afterwards, on Friday at 22:00. Notably, this was broadcast with original English commentary only. This lasted until the organization went defunct in 2002.

Roughly during the same period, and as early as 1994, DSF (_Deutsche Sport Fernsehen_), a German sport TV channel, available through satellite receivers and later also in several cable networks, was showing World Wrestling Federation's shows after 22:00, on various days through the years, settling on Saturdays.
Later listings from 2002 advertised WCW in that timeslot, which may have been an error.

In 1998, a new general TV channel named Wizja 1 (_Vision One_) was launched. Its programming also included wrestling, on Saturdays at 18:00, airing WWF Superstars with commentary by Tomasz Lorek, Grzegorz Kalinowski and Andrzej Supron.

Around 1998, general purpose channel Polsat 2 also broadcasted WCW, though not the flagship show. The show was named "Wszystkie Chwyty Dozwolone" (_Catch-as-catch-can_), and aired on Saturday mornings, with commentary by Michał Olszański and others.

## 2021

The newly created [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) streamed their first ever show, [PTW#1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) on both YouTube and TVP Sport. While only streamed, not broadcast, it is notable because TVP Sport is the national broadcaster's sports channel.

## 2023

In September, PpW's social media announced that [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md) will be available not only on their YouTube channel, but [also on TV][czysteintencje-fb].
The channel was sportowa.tv, a general sports-oriented channel available in several smaller cable networks in Poland, and over the Internet.
Social media graphics for that event show the channel's logo among other partners and sponsors. This cooperation appears to have been short-lived, as the channel was not mentioned on any of the later shows, and there is no video of the even on their YouTube channel.

During the opening moments of [Arena 23](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md), [Chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) announced that from this moment on, KPW's events would be broadcast on cable TV, on an MMA and wrestling-focused channel FightBox. The first show to air was indeed Arena 23. Following shows were recorded by cameras, for the purpose of airing them later after recording commentary.

## 2024


In August 2024, PTW launched a format on TVT, which is a local Silesian TV station. The show is titled "Czas na Wrestling" (_Time For Wrestling_), and hosted by [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), who typically interviews a single guest from the organization, whether a wrestler or crew member, talking various wrestling or PTW-related topics. Some of these episodes are hosted by TVT on [their website][tvt-czas], and available on YouTube.

On Sunday, Sep 29, 2024, breakfast TV programme "Halo tu Polsat" featured [a brief segment][halo-tu-ppw] with PpW's wrestlers [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). Gustav brought his custom [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) belt, which was prominently displayed on a coffee table, with PpW's logo clearly legible.
The hosts asked the wrestlers several questions, including about the nature of kayfabe and their roles and characters. Biesiad was portrayed as a pure fighter, while Gustav promoted himself as a man of culture and means, deserving the championship he carried. Crane was referred to mostly as "coach".

Some time later, in October, PTW announced that their shows will be aired by Extreme Sports channel, starting with [PTW#1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), which aired on October 27th.
This was later followed by Extreme starting to air the Underground series of shows.
The first one to air was [PTW Underground 4](@/e/ptw/2022-04-24-ptw-underground-4.md), scheduled on Monday, November 18th 2024 at 22:00 (10PM), and was followed by more Underground shows on the following days.

On November 11th, fans noticed that Extreme Sports website now [promoted Legacy of Wrestling][extreme-low-1].
The following day Legacy [officially confirmed][extreme-low-2] their media partnership, and that their [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) would air on Extreme one week after the event, on December 8th.

One week later, on November 18th, Extreme and [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) also posted about signing a deal to air their shows, starting with [KPW Arena 23: Zabójcze Wyzwanie](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md) on Saturday, November 23rd.
It is unclear if their shows will continue to air on FightBox.
