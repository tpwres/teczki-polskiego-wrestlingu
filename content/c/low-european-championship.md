## History

The first mention of a "Legacy Championship" dates back to the [live Q&A][qna-legacy] hosted by [Legacy's](@/o/low.md) before their [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md). The build-up, called "Road to the Title", started at that event with a series of matches which were continued at [Ryucon](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) later that year. Wrestlers who advanced to the finals were [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md), [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/jakub.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md). During the build-up to [Four the Glory](@/e/low/2025-12-20-low-4.md), the title was finally revealed and named "Legacy of Wrestling European Championship".

## Belt design

Overall, the Legacy of Wrestling European Championship is heavily inspired in shape and design by the [NEVER Openweight Championship][never-openweight], a championship promoted by [New Japan Pro-Wrestling][njpw]. The main gold centre plate with silver details is decorated with various ornaments, with big "LEGACY" written in black and gold. Over and under the main logo there are two banners with "EUROPEAN" and "CHAMPION" engraved on it. Two identical sideplates are also made in gold, with black cut-out of the European continent on it. The plates are attached to a black leather belt.
