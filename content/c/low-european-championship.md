## History

The first mention of "Legacy Championship" dates back to [live Q&A][qna-legacy] hosted by [Legacy's](@/o/low.md) before their [vol. 2 show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md). The build-up called "Road To The Title" started at the very show with a series of matches which were continued at [third show](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md). Wrestlers, who advanced to the finals were [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md), [David Oliwa](@/david-oliwa.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). During the build-up to forth show [Four The Glory] the championship was finally revealed and named "Legacy of Wrestling European Championship".

## Belt design

Overall, the Legacy of Wrestling European Championship is heavy inspired in shape and design by [NEVER Openweight Championship][never-openweight], a championship promoted by Japaneese promotion [New Japan Pro-Wrestling][njpw]. Main gold centre plate with silver details is decorated by various ornaments with big "LEGACY" written in black and gold. Over and under main logo there are two banners with "EUROPEAN" and "CHAMPION" engraved on it. Two identical sideplates are also made in gold, with black cut-out of european continent on it. The plates are based on black leather belt.
