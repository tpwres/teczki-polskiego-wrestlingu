## History

The title was first mentioned at [PTW #5](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) and officially announced by PTW's owner and General Manager, [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), in a December 2024 interview for the [MyWrestling YouTube channel][pawłowski-my-wrestling-live]. Pawłowski stated that a tournament would be held over the course of several shows, to crown the inaugural champion. 

The tournament actually started at [PTW: Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) and continued at the pace of one match per show. There was little transparency and no bracket was never presented, requiring some assumptions to be made. Following the first round matches, there are four contenders left: [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md), Betty Boa, Heidi Katrina and Lucia Lee. It is likely that the next round will be semi-finals, consisting of two matches between any chosen combination between these four.

Although there were no tournament matches since [PTW: Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md), PTW keeps bringing the tournament up in their programming, reiterating it is still on.

Right before [PTW: All About the Moné](@/e/ptw/2025-07-27-ptw-all-about-the-mone.md), Bestya Slam posted an [interview][pasy-ziemi-wloskiej-i-wolski] with Diana Strong on their social media, talking about the match with Moné. They mention the championships that are going to be contested, which are shown hanging on the ring ropes in the background: Bestya Women's Championship and [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md). This suggests that the tournament was heavily changed or even effectively scrapped, as Diana is the only one qualified to the finals and the other semi-final did not happen yet.

## Belt design

On 27.07.2025, the belt design was revealed in an [Instagram posts](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMm8yPStGKb/) by Bestya Slam. It includes an elliptic plate with PTW logo, mainly in black with pink accents and a pink crown on top. Visible is the octagonal strap, possibly repurposed from the initial [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) belts.
