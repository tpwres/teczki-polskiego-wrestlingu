## History

On 17.10.2025 - during the buid-up to [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md) - PpW shared an image of [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) teasing a "Very Huge and Very Important Announcement" to be made at the show, which was supposed to change the course of PpW forever. During the opening moments of the show [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) and [Joker](@/w/joker.md), on Z's behalf, introduced the newly-created PpW Tag Team Championship, along with the tournament to crown the inaugural champions, starting with the [next show](@/e/ppw/2025-11-08-ppw-surowy-klimat.md).
The tournament consisted of semi-finals with both [Rodzina](@/tt/rodzina.md) and [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) quickly advancing to the finals, with their wins at [Surowy Klimat](@/e/ppw/2025-11-08-ppw-surowy-klimat.md) and [Duch Świąt, Smak Krwi](@/e/ppw/2025-12-06-ppw-duch-swiat-smak-krwi.md).
In addition, [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) were forced to become a tag team and at [PpW Najlepsza Gala w Mieście [Hardcore Edition]](@/e/ppw/2026-01-16-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie-hardcore-edition.md) they fought Rodzina's representation for the opportunity to join the finals. After their win, Gustav & Goblin were denied an opportunity by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and forced to fight another match for the same opportunity the same night, this time against Zmowa's other representation of [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) & [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md). After succesfully defeating the next team, Gustav & Goblin have officially been added to the finals.
Seemingly, the tournament involved _Freebird Rule_. Oskar Alexander advanced to the finals with Vic Golden and later fought Gustav & Goblin together with [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md). This was supposedly Rodzina's designed representation for the finals, but later it was [confirmed](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTs_vmZignE/) that due to Queen's obstruction, he will not be joining Alexander in the finals. Instead, a new member of Rodzina will be fighting.

## Belt design

The overall shape of the PpW Tag Team Championship is heavily influenced by the [WWE Tag Team Championship][pas-wwe-tag-team] belt used from 2024 onwards. The main plate is made with silver metal with ornaments and black details. At top-centre of the main plate there is a purple-coloured PpW logo with iconic "eyes" over it. At both sides of the logo there are two skulls facing outwards, representing two persons being tag team champions. The bottom half of the centre plate is decorated with two banners, the first one with "Tag Team" engraved in silver, and the second one with "Wrestling Champions" engraved in purple. Looking from the front there is a left sideplate with two skulls on it, and at the right a sideplate decorated with stylised "Tag Team" written on it. All of plates are attached to a black leather belt.
