MCW Championship is [Mine City Wrestling's](@/o/mcw.md) only title. Despite MCW starting years earlier, the belt was only introduced in late 2019 due lack of funds and personal difficulties, as well as the promotion's wish to have the best-looking title possible.

## Statistics:

* First champion: [Johny Vegas](@/w/johny-vegas.md)
* Shortest reign: Jack Kalom (1+ days)
* Longest reign: Johny Vegas (1127 days)

## Belt design

The belt is made out of thin metal sheets with gold-and-black lettering and ornaments. The main plate is flat, and all of the decour is engraved on it. In its centre is the MCW logo with eagle wings over it, and "Mine City Wrestling Champion" placed on banners below it. The rest of the main plate is filled with simple engravings. On each side of the main plate there are two pairs of smaller, rectangular sideplates. Both pairs of sideplates contain two different silhouettes of retro-styled wrestlers. All of the plates are attached to a basic black leather strap.
