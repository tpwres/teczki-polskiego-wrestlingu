Gold Rush Rumble is a professional wrestling match based on the clasic [Royal Rumble][royal-rumble]. This match is promoted by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

## Concept

Gold Rush Rumble match closely resembles Royal Rumble known from World Wrestling Entertaiment. The match begins with two wrestlers with the remaining wrestlers entering the ring at irregular timed intervals (circa 1:30 minutes, but it may vary). The match traditionally involves 20 wrestlers. The original twist in the first edition marked that final four turns the match into Elimination Fatal Four Way Match with wins being allowed only by Pinfall or Submission, instead of throwing your oponent above top rope. This idea was seemingly scrapped during second edition, as the rules of Gold Rush Rumble remained the same until the end of the match.

## Prize 

As of 2025 the main prize of Gold Rush Rumble varies. During first edition of Gold Rush Rumble the winner was crowned as inaugural [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md) while on the second edition the winner of a match was awarded a #1 Contender spot for [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) - PTW's secondary title.
