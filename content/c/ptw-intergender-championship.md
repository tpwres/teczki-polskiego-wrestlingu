The PTW Intergender Championship is a joke DIY professional wrestling championship made out of cardboard.

<!-- more -->

## History

The title was hand-made by [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) for his fight with [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) at [PTW Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md). Although it was introduced as a joke title, Marco defended it as if it were a proper Championship and boasted about his victory afterwards. PTW only vaguely recognised the title and after Marco Hammers left the promotion, he took the title belt with him.

## Belt design

The belt is made out of cardboard and black duct tape, with text and graphical elements in black and yellow markers. The front "plate" says "Intergender PTW Championship" below a crown, while the side "plates" show the male and female symbols (♀ and ♂), also with crowns.
