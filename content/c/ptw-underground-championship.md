## History

The title was first mentioned in a December 2024 interview for the [MyWrestling YouTube channel][pawłowski-my-wrestling-live]. Pawłowski stated that a tournament would be held to crown the inaugural champion. Unlike the [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md) title tournament, this one would happen entirely at [one show](@/e/ptw/2025-02-15-ptw-wrestlingowe-walentynki.md).
