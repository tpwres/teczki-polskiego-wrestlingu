## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-present)

#### Debut as a referee

Rafał made his debut as a referee in August 2022, as the sole official at [Underground 7](@/e/ptw/2022-08-28-ptw-underground-7.md).
He joined Referees [Matek](@/w/sedzia-matek.md) and [Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) and began to make regular appearances at PTW shows since then, while still training to become a full-time wrestler.

#### Asian Scandal and becoming S.Rafał

In late 2024 he was nominated for [PTW Awards 2022](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md), in the "Referee of the Year" category.
During the popular vote, he was outvoted by Matek and Sewi by over 100 votes each, when he unexpectedly gained a couple hundred votes.
Upon closer examination, it appeared that all of his votes were in fact purchased from a bot website; all of them were coming from Vietnam.
This was dubbed the "Asian Scandal", with Rafał being the main suspect.
The real-life controversy was turned into a storyline, where the main prosecutors in Rafał's trial were Sewi The Referee and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), who named Rafał "Srafał" ("Rafał" with the "sra-" prefix - meaning "Shit-fał").
Even though it was later revealed that it was a fan - Szymon "Modzel" Modzelewski - who was behind the entire situation, Rafał was still suspended from his Referee duties.
In addition, he also got involved into a squash match against Puncher at [Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md) as a last-chance opportunity to save himself from the suspension.

He made his return as a cocky heel persona still caled S.Rafał at [Underground 20](@/e/ptw/2023-12-10-ptw-underground-20.md) where he was once again quickly defeated, this time by [King Kaiden](@/w/king-kaiden.md).

At [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) S.Rafał joined the Gold Rush Battle Royal for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), but was quickly eliminated by [Santino Marella](@/w/santino.md).

#### Becoming Alex Brave

At [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) he officialy declared his name change to "Alex Brave", while still maintaining his cocky over-intellectual heel persona.
Later in 2024, Alex formed an alliance with another heel, [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), to feud against [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md). He also started his own recurring segment, calling it the "Alex Brave Show".

At [Underground 25: Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md) he challenged Miyagi Shida to a Career Threating Match, where his victory will mean that Shida would be fired from PTW. However, Brave was unsucessful in defeating his opponent. After [Pan Pawłowkski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) - PTW's chairman - turned heel by attacking [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) Alex Brave quickly alligned himself with villainous chairman, often praising him in social media, same as Caravaggio and Puncher. Brave was also one of the contenders for inaugural [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), but he was defeated in first round of the tournament by [Blaze](@/w/blaze.md) at [Wrestlingowe Walentynki](@/e/ptw/2025-02-15-ptw-wrestlingowe-walentynki.md).

Alex got involved in a main event of [Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md) where he and Vincent ambushed chairman Okoński before a match and put him through a commentary table. They were, however, chased off by [Andrzej Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md) - special guest referee for a match - who headbutted both of the attackers.
