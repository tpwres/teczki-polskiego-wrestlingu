## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-present)

#### Debut as a referee

Rafał made his debut as a referee in August 2022, as the sole official at [Underground 7](@/e/ptw/2022-08-28-ptw-underground-7.md).
He joined Referees [Matek](@/w/sedzia-matek.md) and [Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), and began to make regular appearances at PTW shows since then, while still training to become a full-time wrestler.

#### The Asian Scandal and becoming S.Rafał

In the late 2024 Rafał was nominated for the [PTW Awards](@/a/ptw-awards.md), in the "Referee of the Year" category. During the popular vote he was initially outvoted by Matek and Sewi, but unexpectedly gained a couple hundred votes. These turned out to be illegitimate, coming from Vietnamese accounts, so the incident was later dubbed the "Asian Scandal".

This real-life controversy was turned into a storyline, where the main prosecutors in Rafał's trial were Sewi The Referee and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), who named Rafał "Srafał" ("Rafał" with the "sra-" prefix - meaning "Shit-fał").
Even though it was later revealed that it was a fan - Szymon "Modzel" Modzelewski - who was behind the entire situation, Rafał was still suspended from his refereeing duties.
In addition, he also got involved into a squash match against Puncher at [Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md) as a last-chance opportunity to save himself from the suspension.

He made his return as a cocky heel persona - still caled S.Rafał - at [Underground 20](@/e/ptw/2023-12-10-ptw-underground-20.md), where he was once again quickly defeated, this time by [King Kaiden](@/w/king-kaiden.md).

At [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) S.Rafał joined the Gold Rush Battle Royal for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), but was quickly eliminated by [Santino Marella](@/w/santino.md).

#### Becoming Alex Brave

At [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) he officialy declared his name change to "Alex Brave", while still maintaining his cocky over-intellectual heel persona.
Later in 2024, Alex formed an alliance with another heel, [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), to feud against [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md). He also started his own recurring segment, calling it the "Alex Brave Show".

At [Underground 25: Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md) he challenged Miyagi Shida to a Career Threating Match, where Shida's loss would result in PTW firing him.
However, Brave was unsuccessful in defeating his opponent.
After [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), PTW's chairman, turned heel by attacking [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), Alex Brave quickly allied himself with the villainous chairman, often praising him in social media, just like his fellow heels Caravaggio and Puncher.
Brave was also one of the contenders for the inaugural [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), but lost in the first round of the tournament to [Blaze](@/w/blaze.md) at [Wrestlingowe Walentynki](@/e/ptw/2025-02-15-ptw-wrestlingowe-walentynki.md).

Alex got involved in the main event of [Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md), where he and Vincent ambushed chairman Okoński before his match and put him through the commentary table. They were, however, chased off by [Andrzej Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md) - the special guest referee for the match - who headbutted both of the attackers.

#### Royal Rebels and Nietykalni

At [Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md) Pawłowski expressed his gratitude for both Brave and Caravaggio, praising them for their actions at Prezes vs Prezes. He formed a tag team of Brave and Caravaggio - [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md) - and introduced them into a new Pawłowski-centered faction called [Nietyklani](@/tt/nietykalni.md) (_The Untouchables_), consisting of all of them and Puncher. They were given the opportunity to face [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md) at the same show. Brave and Vincent managed to score a victory, becoming the new [PTW Tag Team Champions](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). From that point onwards Nietykalni ruled over PTW, constantly feuding with Łukasz Okoński and his allies: [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) and referees [Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) and [Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md), who tried to stand their ground at [Apokalipsa](@/e/ptw/2025-08-30-ptw-apokalipsa.md), but were bullied into submission by Royal Rebels.

## International wrestling appearances

In January 2024 Alex Brave (then named S. Rafał) made his international debut at a PTW/WWA show. He also made one more appearance in PTW-affiliated federation BestYa Wrestling in Italy, which took place in January 2025.
