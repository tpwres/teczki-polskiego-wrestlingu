## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2012)

Adi competed in [Backyardmania III](@/e/pxw/2012-07-24-pxw-backyardmania-3.md) (as Dirty Devil), where he want against Nick Violent in a Hardcore Match.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023-present)

Adi made his professional wrestling debut as an announcer for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in 2023 at their first show after a long hiatus, [Game ON](@/e/mzw/2023-03-11-mzw-game-on.md). At this show he filled the shoes of [Mateusz Czarnecki](@/w/mateusz-czarnecki.md), who'd departed from the company after the recording of [MZW Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md). From that point on he became the main host and ring announcer of MZW, where he distinguished himself by often making his in-ring announcements in English - in the fashion of [Michael Buffer][michal-bufor], including his trademark (and trademarked) phrase "Let's get ready to rumble!".

During [Zjedz Mu Łeb](@/e/mzw/2025-09-27-mzw-zjedz-mu-leb.md) show he took part in a [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) versus [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) rivalry by opting by fan-favourite side and showing his lack of respect against bald hooligans. In a post-match chaos after Marcelito and Olgierd bout he even struck the latter with a kendo stick, which bought enough time for Shadow to get upper hand over Olgierd.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025-present)

On December 20th, 2025 Adrian made his first appearance for [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), working as announcer during their [fourth show](@/e/low/2025-12-20-low-4.md).
