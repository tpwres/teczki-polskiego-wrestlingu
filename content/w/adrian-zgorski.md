## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023-present)

Adi made his professional wrestling debut as an announcer for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in 2023 at their first show after a long hiatus, [Game ON](@/e/mzw/2023-03-11-mzw-game-on.md). At this show he filled the shoes of [Mateusz Czarnecki](@/w/mateusz-czarnecki.md), who'd departed from the company after the recording of [MZW Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md). From that point on he became the main host and ring announcer of MZW, where he distinguished himself by often making his in-ring announcements in English - in the fashion of [Michael Buffer][michal-bufor], including his trademark (and trademarked) phrase "Let's get ready to rumble!"
