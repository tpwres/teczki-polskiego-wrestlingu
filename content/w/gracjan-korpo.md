## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Gracjan Korpo made his in-ring debut for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in December 2014 at an [event held in Gdańsk](@/e/ddw/2014-12-13-ddw-12.md). In his first match he defeated [Fatman](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). He was portraying a villainous character of a corporate worker fighting in a white shirt and tie, and often utilising his briefcase as a weapon. He also worked with his manager [Krzysztof Zasada](@/w/krzysztof-zasada.md). In total, Gracjan made three appearances in DDW before it folded, with the last one taking place at [Baltikon](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

After DDW's transformation into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Gracjan and his manager Krzysztof remained with the federation. Gracjan debuted during [show at Gdynia Game Festival](@/e/kpw/2015-12-11-kpw-ggf.md) in December 2015. For most of his tenure in KPW he mostly worked as a midcard enhancement talent, feuding with babyfaces such as [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md). 

At [Arena 7](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7-wysoka-stawka.md) Gracjan defeated [Mateusz Kowalski](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md), but after the match he was finally attacked by his manager Krzysztof Zasada, who was fed up with Gracjan's mobbing. This led to their match at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), which was quickly won by Korpo. 

At [Arena 12](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12-gwiazda-polnocy.md) in April 2019 Gracjan surprisingly won a match against [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) which granted him a #1 Contender Qualifier spot for [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) against David Oliwa. At [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md) he lost due to [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md) intervention, which led to their fight at [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14-nastepny-poziom.md), which was lost by Gracjan. This marks his last apperance in KPW.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

After leaving KPW, Gracjan joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) - a silesian-based federation operated by his old collegue from DDW and KPW, [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). Besides working as a coach in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) for a short time, he managed to score one apperance at PTW's first show, [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), against British wrestler Nick Aldis. The match was poorly recieved by fans due to many botches and weak booking. Afterwards, Gracjan made no more appearances for PTW, seemingly retiring from wrestling.
