## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Gracjan Korpo made his official in-ring debut for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in December 2014 at an [event held in Gdańsk](@/e/ddw/2014-12-13-ddw-12.md) (although he'd appeared as a rookie in a Battle Royal at [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md)). In his first match he defeated [Fatman](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). He was portraying a villainous character of an angry, ruthless corporate worker fighting in a white shirt and tie, and often utilising his briefcase as a weapon. He also worked with his manager [Krzysztof Zasada](@/w/krzysztof-zasada.md), whom he often abused verbally. In total, Gracjan made three appearances in DDW before it folded, with the last one taking place at [Baltikon](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

After DDW's transformation into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Gracjan and his manager Krzysztof remained with the federation. Gracjan debuted during [Gdynia Game Festival](@/e/kpw/2015-12-11-kpw-ggf.md) in December 2015. For most of his tenure in KPW he worked as midcard enhancement talent, feuding with babyfaces such as [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md).

At [Arena 7](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7.md) Gracjan defeated [Mateusz Kowalski](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md), but after the match he was finally attacked by his manager Krzysztof Zasada, who was fed up with Gracjan's mobbing. This led to their match at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), which Korpo quickly won, despite fan's support for his opponent. Later at the same show, Korpo inserted himself as the eighth competitor in a Magnificent Seven Ladder Match, where the prize was a [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) title-shot.

At [Arena 12](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12.md) in April 2019 Gracjan surprisingly won a match against [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) which granted him a #1 Contender Qualifier match for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), against David Oliwa. At [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md) Korpo lost due to an intervention by [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md).
This led to their fight at [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md), which Gracjan lost. This marked his last appearance in KPW.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

After leaving KPW, Gracjan joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) - a new Silesia-based federation operated by his old colleague from DDW and KPW, [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). Besides working as a coach in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) for a short time, he managed to score a match at PTW's very first show, [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), against British wrestler Nick Aldis. The match was poorly recieved by fans due to many botches and weak booking. Afterwards, Gracjan made no more appearances for PTW, seemingly retiring from wrestling.
