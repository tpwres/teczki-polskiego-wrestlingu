## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Luxus made his debut on the Polish wrestling scene in August 2013, when he participated in [DDW Charity Event](@/e/ddw/2013-08-25-ddw-charity-event.md). He immediately allied himself with [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), becoming one of the founding members of [Kawaleria](@/tt/kawaleria.md): a villainous stable led by Kawaler himself. His biggest singles achievement from that time would be a victory in a Battle Royal, which was hosted at DDW's [second house show](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md) in May 2015.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2016)

After DDW's closure and transformation into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Luxus remained in both KPW and Kawaleria. He spent most of his career teaming with fellow Kawaleria member [GREG](@/w/greg.md) and accompanying the leader of his stable. After Kawaleria's victory over [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) at [Godzina Zero 2016](@/e/kpw/2016-08-13-kpw-godzina-zero-2016.md), Luxus vanished from KPW, seemingly retiring from professional wrestling.
