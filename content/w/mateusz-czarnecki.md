## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2019-2021)

Mateusz started his pro-wrestling career in the [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) dojo, [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md). He initially aimed to become a wrestler, but due to health issues he decided to shift toward running the shows. He replaced the retiring [Tomasz Warcho≈Ç](@/w/tomasz-warchol.md) at [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) and continued to work as a host and ring announcer up until [MZW Project 8: Golden Road Finals](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md). He did not return to MZW after their 2022 hiatus, seemingly retiring from wrestling.

### PpW Ewenement (2024)

In October 2024 Mateusz made a surprise apperance as an interviewer at [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), temporary replacing [Konrad "Joker" Grzesikiewicz](@/w/joker.md) in the role.
