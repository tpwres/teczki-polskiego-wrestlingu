Not much is known about Chudy's career due to lack of avaliable information about [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md) itself. It is known that he made appearances there from May 2013 until February 2014. During his stint in backyard federation he unsucesfully challenged [Casey Collins](@/w/casey-collins.md) for Wołów Championship. Later on he won WKSW Championship from [Raven](@/w/raven.md) but not much is known about his reign afterwards.
