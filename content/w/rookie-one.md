## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2025-)

Although he didn't have an official debut yet, Rookie One had a few fights at KPW shows. He made his first appearance at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md), where he faced [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) in a 3-on-1 Handicap Match, alongside [Rookie Two](@/w/rookie-two.md) and [Rookie Three](@/w/rookie-three.md). The fan-given name "Rookie One" originated at this event, as the rookies weren't individually introduced.

Rookie One also appeared as Oskar Fux at two side shows, in [Kadzidło](@/e/kpw/2025-09-06-kpw-kadzidlo.md) and [Trzebień](@/e/kpw/2025-09-13-kpw-talon-smackdown.md), where he took the place of [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) and [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) respectively.
