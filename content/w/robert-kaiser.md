## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2016)

Robert Kaiser made few apperances in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) back in its early years thanks to good relations between polish federation, and german - especially Drezden-based - scene. He debuted at [MZW in Smolec](@/e/mzw/2014-06-21-mzw-untitled.md) show in June 2014. For the most part of his stint in MZW he served mostly as enhancement talent to fill up the card with matches. One time he appeared as 	BPWF Tag Team Champion alongside his partner Nickolas von Rijk to defeat Zbójnicy: [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bułecka.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). 

Robert made his last apperance in MZW at [Champions War II](@/e/mzw/2016-01-10-mzw-champions-war-2.md), where he was defeated by [Franz Engel](@/w/franz-engel.md).
