## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2011-2012)
Shadow started out as a backyard wrestler for [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) in his hometown Głuchołazy where he performed as Terry Shadow, showcasing his high-risk, high-flying style. During his time in this backyard promotion he managed to win their ECW Championship at least once.

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013)

2013 was the year when Terry Shadow left PXW to start professional training with [Do or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in Rzeszów, joining their roster as Straceniec (_The Condemned_). However, he only had two fights: at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) and [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md).
Dissatisfied with [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md)'s way of running the promotion, he left along with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) in order to start a new federation.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2013-present)

#### Głuchołazy Era
Shadow started Maniac Zone Wrestling along with Jędruś Bułecka in Głuchołazy. From the very start of the federation he was considered one of the most influencial figures in MZW and one of their top babyfaces, despite his mysterious and ambigous gimmick.

In 2016 he briefly feuded with [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) for the [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). He won it in a Loser Leaves Town Match at [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md). He held the title for 385 days until he was defeated by [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) in a hardcore match at [MZW Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md). He regained it over 225 days later at [MZW Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md) - the last show held in Głuchołazy.

During that time he continued his training abroad, attending classes mostly in Germany. From that point on he also started making regular apperances at German federations such as Next Step Wrestling, and later also Eastside Revolution Wrestling.

#### Moving to Wrocław; "Project" Era and gaining control 

After MZW's move to Wrocław, Jędruś Bułecka began to slowly withdraw from MZW operations due to personal reasons. From mid-2018 to mid-2019 Maniac Zone Wrestling was _de facto_ ran by Shadow, Justin Joy and Asmund. During that time MZW hosted shows regurally.

Shadow's second reign as MZW Champion ended when he was defeated by [Damien Rotschild](@/e/mzw/2019-02-09-mzw-project-3-black-white.md).

After [PAW's](@/o/paw.md) summercamp 2019 and [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), Asmund and Justin vacated their positions as members of MZW's board, leaving Shadow as the sole owner of MZW and PAW. 

Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, MZW was forced to cease their operations for a longer time. However, during that break Shadow decided to produce taped events held in the [Ostrowskiego](@/v/ostrowskiego-wroclaw.md) venue, called [MZW Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md). He also dealt with the "Green Revolution" - a huge loss of talent due to personal and managerial conflicts with members of ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md).

After the COVID pandemic, Shadow continued to run Maniac Zone Wrestling events as the promoter and one of in-ring workers - albeit with a rather irregular schedule. He also continued as the head coach of PAW, which moved operations to Kępno.

In addition to performing in Poland, Shadow has also wrestled for a number of international promotions, particularly for Germany-based Eastside Revolution Wrestling.

### PpW Ewenement  (2023-2024)

In late 2023 Shadow made history by co-organising a joint show [MZW+PpW: Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md), thus finally acknowledging [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) as a professional federation on the Polish wrestling scene. He later cemented that by making his PpW debut a couple of months later at [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

In December 2024 Shadow was announced as one of the stars of the newly-founded federation called [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), and was scheduled to face [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) at their [inaugural show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md).
