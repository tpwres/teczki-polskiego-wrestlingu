## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2011-2012)

Shadow started out as a backyard wrestler for [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) in his hometown Głuchołazy, where he performed as Terry Shadow, showcasing his high-risk, high-flying style. During his time in this backyard promotion he managed to win their ECW Championship at least once.

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013)

2013 was the year when Terry Shadow left PXW to start professional training with [Do or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in Rzeszów, joining their roster as Straceniec (_The Condemned_). However, he only had two fights: at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) and [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md).
Dissatisfied with [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md)'s way of running the promotion, Shadow left along with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Rider](@/w/asmund.md) in order to start a new federation on his own terms.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2013-present)

#### Głuchołazy Era

Upon returning to Głuchołazy, Shadow started Maniac Zone Wrestling along with Jędruś Bułecka. From the outset, he became one of the most influential figures in MZW and one of their top babyfaces, despite his mysterious and ambiguous gimmick.

In 2016, Shadow briefly feuded with [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) over the [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). He won the title in a Loser Leaves Town Match at [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md) and held it for 385 days until he was defeated by [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) in a hardcore match at [MZW Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md). He regained the title over 225 days later at [MZW Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md), which would be the last show held in Głuchołazy.

During that time, Shadow continued his training abroad, attending classes mostly in Germany. He also began making regular appearances at German federations such as Next Step Wrestling, and later Eastside Revolution Wrestling.

#### Moving to Wrocław; "Project" Era and gaining control 

After MZW moved to Wrocław, Jędruś Bułecka began to slowly step away from MZW operations due to personal reasons. From mid-2018 to mid-2019 Maniac Zone Wrestling was effectively ran by Shadow, Justin Joy and Asmund. During that time, MZW hosted shows regularly.

Shadow's second reign as MZW Champion ended when he was defeated by [Damien Rotschild](@/e/mzw/2019-02-09-mzw-project-3-black-white.md).

Following the [PAW](@/o/paw.md) summer camp of 2019 and [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), Asmund and Justin vacated their positions as members of MZW's board, leaving Shadow as the sole owner of MZW and PAW.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, MZW was forced to temporarily halt their operations. However, during this break, Shadow decided to produce taped events held in the [Ostrowskiego](@/v/ostrowskiego-wroclaw.md) venue, known as [MZW Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md). He also dealt with the "Green Revolution" - a significant loss of talent due to personal and managerial conflicts with members of ["The Greens"](@/tt/zieloni.md).

After the COVID pandemic, Shadow continued to run Maniac Zone Wrestling events as both the promoter and an in-ring performer, albeit with a rather irregular schedule. He also continued as the head coach of PAW, which moved operations to Kępno.

In addition to performing in Poland, Shadow has also wrestled for several international promotions, particularly for Germany-based Eastside Revolution Wrestling.

### PpW Ewenement  (2023-2024)

In late 2023 Shadow made history by co-organizing a joint show [MZW+PpW: Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md) with [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), thereby finally acknowledging them as a professional federation. He later cemented that by making his PpW debut a couple of months later at [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-)

In December 2024 Shadow was announced as one of the stars of the newly-founded federation called [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), and faced [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) at their [inaugural show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). He returned for the [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) to take part in the Fatal Five-Way Match, albeit unsuccessfully.
