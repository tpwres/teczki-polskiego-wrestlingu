Shadow started out as a backyard wrestler for [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) (PXW) where he performed as Terry Shadow, showcasing his high-risk, high-flying style. 
He later started professional training with [DDW](@/o/ddw.md), joining their roster as Straceniec (_The Condemned_) but only had two fights: at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) and [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md).
Dissatisfied with [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md)'s way of running the promotion, he left along with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) in order to start a new federation, [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), of which he remains the sole owner. He is a two-time [MZW Champion](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md).

In addition to performing in Poland, Shadow has also wrestled for a number of international promotions, particularly for Germany-based Eastside Revolution Wrestling.
