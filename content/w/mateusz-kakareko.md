## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Mateusz started his pro wrestling career in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) under the "Mateusz Kowalski" alias. He played a simple babyface gimmick. His debut took place in August 2013 at [DDW's eight show](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md), where he was defeated by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md). He continued to work in DDW mostly as an enhancement talent for more pushed talent such as [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) and [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md). However, he managed to score one single victory over [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) at [DDW Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/ddw/2014-08-16-ddw-pokaz-adeptow.md) in August 2014.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

#### Mateusz Kowalski's losing streak

After DDW folded and subsequently transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Mateusz joined the federation shortly after, slightly transforming his gimmick into a tweener-leaning simple Polish everyman. He debuted in a tag team match against [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) at [KPW Arena 4](@/e/kpw/2016-11-26-kpw-arena-4.md) in November 2016, where he and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) were defeated by the babyfaces. From this point on Mateusz Kowalski made several irregular appearances in KPW, ocasionally teaming up with [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md), but he failed to score a single win, which started to weigh on him.

#### Mateusz Kakareko

Before [KPW Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md) the federation published a short vignette by Mateusz, in which he recalled his previous successes in taekwondo, such as being the European champion. He grew bitter with being an "ordinary Kowalski" (the Polish equivalent of "Joe Public" or "John Doe") for so many years and decided to go back to his old self. At Arena X in May 2018 he fought [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md) using much different, more aggresive style. He managed to score his first victory in Kombat Pro Wrestling. This victory, however, did not lead Kakareko into a bigger push. Despite the change in style and the fact that he entered both the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match at [Godzina Zero 2018](@/e/kpw/2018-08-11-kpw-godzina-zero-2018.md) and the tournament for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md), he was not able to repeat his success from Arena X. 

Mateusz Kakareko made his last appearance as one of the contenders in the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match at [KPW Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md). After that he seemingly retired from professional wrestling.
