## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2019-2023)

Tony Sk1n made his official wrestling debut at the first official PpW show open for public - [2Ko≈Ça to my nie zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md). Since then, he made rather regular appearances at PpW shows between 2021 and 2023. For most of his career he portrayed a heel persona, aligning with [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md).

At [Piwa i Igrzysk](@/e/ppw/2023-03-11-ppw-piwa-i-igrzysk.md) he faced [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md) in a Loser Leaves PpW Match, in which he was defeated by the Specialist from Pabianice. 

Despide his kayfabe leaving PpW, Sk1n made a one-off return, answering [Adam Wong's](@/w/adam-wong.md) Hardcore Open Challenge at [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md) under the "Black Ninja" alias, with his real identity revealed after the match. 

This angle was never followed up on and after Czyste Intencje, Tony Sk1n quietly left the federation and presumably retired from in-ring competition.
