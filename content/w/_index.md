Links typeset in _italics_ are aliases used by a character besides their current name or gimmick. Names that are not links represent talent that doesn't have a dedicated page yet.

Each name is followed by a list of organizations they appeared for. If they have less than 5 matches (under that name), numbered links to events will be added after each organization name.

A flag appearing next to the name signifies that person's nationality, if known and relevant.
