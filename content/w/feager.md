## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2015-present)

#### Backyard era

Feager joined [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) back in their backyard days, some time around mid-2015. In his early days - unlike many other PpW wrestlers - he worked only under his main alias "Feager" (pronounced like "pager"), a character strongly influenced by wrestlers such as the Undertaker, Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns. At the time he also teamed up with [Steven Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) and [Hirinus](@/w/mister-z.md). Feager made his last appearance for the backyard-era PpW in his promo announcing his appearance at [Kiedyś Będzie Lepiej](@/e/ppw/2019-07-13-ppw-kiedys-bedzie-lepiej.md), where he no-showed the Tornado Hardcore Match. 

#### Return and early feuds

Feager returned to PpW after a nearly two-year hiatus, making his appearance at [Inside Job](@/e/ppw/2021-09-11-ppw-inside-job.md) in September 2021, where he faced [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md) and [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md). This led him to two rematches against Tony and Wong at [Mistrz Jest Tylko Jeden](@/e/ppw/2022-03-12-ppw-mistrz-jest-tylko-jeden.md) and [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md), respectively. After defeating [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) at [Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md), he unexpectedly alligned himself with Ms. XXX - [Mister Z's](@/w/mister-z.md) manager, who dumped him after his loss against [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), only to immedietely kiss Feager and become his manager. This alliance didn't last long, as Ms. XXX left Feager - and PpW - some time after [Back to the OG](@/e/ppw/2023-02-04-ppw-back-to-the-og.md).

#### PpW Champion

After ending his alliance with Ms. XXX, Feager spent most of 2023 working in midcard matches. At the last show of the year - [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) - he defeated [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), which granted him a #1 Contender Spot for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md). He faced [Steve Kuningas](@/w/steve-kuningas.md) at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) and managed to win, which made him the fifth PpW Champion in the history of the professional-era PpW. Feager sucessfully defended his championship against Mister Z at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md). At [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) he faced both Mister Z and Biesiad Strong in a Triple Threat Match for PpW Championship, which ended in Feager's defeat and loss of his championship, ending his reign after 119 days. 

#### Various storylines

After losing his PpW Championship Feager held a grudge against Biesiad, leading them to fight at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) in a Delivery Van Match, which was ruled a no-contest. Later on he also faced [Alex Arthur](@/w/alex-arthur.md) in a Chairs Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), and Biesiad again - dressed as Santa Claus - at [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz z Krzesłami](@/e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md). At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) Feager entered the 20 Typa 20 Broni Match for an opportunity to face the PpW Champion at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md), but was unsucessful in winning that match. 

#### Rivalry with Sambor

At [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) Feager took part in the Enigma Scramble Match against [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md), [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), where the stake was a match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md). This match resulted in a three-way tie between his opponents, every one of them except Feager scoring a single point. Despite that, Feager made an unannounced appearance at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) where he attacked [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), preventing him from winning the Ladder Match for a PpW Championship fight contract. This, however didn't led to anything, as he quietly vanished from PpW's programming.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

Feager made his first appearance for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) in October 2024, where he faced, and was defeated by, a fellow PpW wrestler, [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md).
