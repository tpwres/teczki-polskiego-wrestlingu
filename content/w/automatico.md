Automatico was a masked luchador from [PpW](@/o/ppw.md). He was usually portrayed by [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md), but at [Crossing Roads 2015](@/e/ppw/2015-08-31-ppw-crossing-roads-2015.md) it was somebody else (likely [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md)) because Scaffold was a referee in Automatico's match.
