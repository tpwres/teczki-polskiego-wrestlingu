Primate is an English pro wrestler from Newcastle, best known for his run in NXT UK with tag team partner [Wild Boar](@/w/wild-boar.md). In Poland, their team won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) in 2019, but was unable to defend it due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With it finally over, the team could not defend the title due to Wild Boar's injury, and they had to vacate it.
