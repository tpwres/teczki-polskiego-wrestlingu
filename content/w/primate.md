## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2019-2022)

Primate made his debut in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) where he defeated [Greg](@/w/greg.md) in a Singles Match. He returned to KPW in February 2020 along with his tag team partner [Wild Boar](@/w/wild-boar.md) at [Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md). They won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) from [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), but were unable to defend it due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the pandemic finally over, the team could not defend the title due to Wild Boar's injury, and they had to vacate it at [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md). After that, Primate tried to reclaim the title with Tommy Freeman as his new partner, but to no avail. He took part in a Championship Contender Battle Royal at the same event, again unsuccessfully. This was his last appearance in KPW.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022)

Shortly after Godzina Zero 2022, Primate made an appearance at [Prime Time Wrestling's](@/o/ptw.md) third major show [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). He faced [Marty Scurll](@/w/marty-scurll.md) in a losing effort.
