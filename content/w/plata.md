## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Training and debut

Bartosz - traditionally billed as _rookie_ Bartosz at the first stages of his career - started his in-ring career in 2024 by training at [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md). Coached by wrestlers such as [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), he made his first appearance at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md) exhibition show in Pozna≈Ñ. His official debut in front of the [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) audience took place at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) in a pre-show match against the victorious [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), as well as Sentinel, Wonder Haze and Atilla. 

#### Run as a rookie

With _rookie_ still part of his billing, Bartosz continued to appear regularly, besides the [20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md), mostly in open challenge matches. This spawned a regular "O kurwa, to Bartek Plata!" (_Oh fuck, it's Bartek Plata!_) commentary reaction at his entrance. After losing in an open challenge against [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) at [Ostatnia Prosta](content/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), in an interview he emphasized his willingness to make a name for himself, not as a rookie anymore, but under his real name, Bartosz Plata. In the same interview, Plata requested a match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md). This request was granted, after he teamed himself with [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) to defeat Hungarian wrestlers Danny Roxx and Atilla.
