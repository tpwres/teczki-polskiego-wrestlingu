## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Training and debut

Bartosz - traditionally billed as _rookie_ Bartosz at the first stages of his career - started his in-ring career in 2024 by training at [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md). Coached by wrestlers such as [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), he made his first appearance at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md) exhibition show in Pozna≈Ñ. His official debut in front of the [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) audience took place at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) in a pre-show match against the victorious [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), as well as Sentinel, Wonder Haze and Atilla. 

#### Run as a rookie

With _rookie_ still part of his billing Bartosz continued to appear regularly, besides the [20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md), mostly in open challenge matches. This spawned a regular "O kurwa, to Bartek Plata!" (_Oh fuck, it's Bartek Plata!_) commentary reaction at his entrance. After losing in an open challenge against [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) at [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), in an interview he emphasized his willingness to make a name for himself, not as a rookie anymore, but under his real name: Bartosz Plata. In the same interview, Plata requested a match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md). This request was granted, after he teamed up with [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) to defeat Hungarian wrestlers Danny Roxx and Atilla.

#### Beginnings of a proper singles run

Starting with [PpW Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-07-05-ppw-turniej-typeshit.md), Plata began a series of challenges dubbed "Wielkie Testy Platy" (_Plata's Grand Trials_), demanding challenging matches against strong opponents. In Chapter 1 of the series he faced the new [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), in a non-title match. Despite losing, he showed his fighting spirit, pushing the champion to his limits. 
His second challenge was an No-Chops Match against the PpW Producer [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) at [Hardcore Friday Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md). Unable to utilize his trademark attack he was defeated by the [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) leader. After the match he additionally suffered a devastating beatdown at the hands of Zmowa.
The third challenge took place during [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md) where he faced rookie Antek and the debuting [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md), but was unable to secure a victory as Antek rolled him up for a pin.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025-present)

#### First appearance

Plata made his first appearance for [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) at [Legacy of Wrestling vol.3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md), teaming up with [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) in a losing effort against the team of [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). He thus became the second [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) graduate to debut outside of [PpW](@/o/ppw.md).
