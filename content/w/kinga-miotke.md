Kinga Miotke is the current ring announcer for KPW.

Kinga started out as a trainee in KPW's wrestling school, but had to abandon her trainings due to a neck injury.
Instead of becoming a wrestler, she would conduct interviews with wrestlers on the backstage and with fans after shows, and eventually she'd take on her role as the ring announcer, starting with [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14-nastepny-poziom.md), taking over from [Arek Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) who left after [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md).
At first she appeared under the ring name "Kinga Różańska", but beginning with [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) she started using her real name, Kinga Miotke.
She is the first and, as of 2024, the only female announcer on the Polish wrestling scene.
