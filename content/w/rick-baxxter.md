## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2020)

#### Posse In Effect

Rick Baxxter made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in June 2014 at their [show in Smolec](@/e/mzw/2014-06-21-mzw-untitled.md). It was possible thanks to good relations between MZW and the German independent scene, especially in Dresden. From 2014 to 2017 Baxxter made a total of nine appearances, mostly in a tag team with [The Grannatic](@/w/the-grannatic.md) as Posse In Effect.

#### Solo appearances

From late 2017 to early 2018 Rick Baxxter stopped appearing in MZW with his tag team partner, instead working solo. He expanded his heel "King of Porn Style" persona which was rather poorly received by the Polish audience, who were not that responsive to sexual allusions as the German public. He made a few more appearances - mostly in multi-man matches - before arriving for the last time at [Project 7: Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md).
