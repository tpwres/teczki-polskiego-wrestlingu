This list contains all the people that appeared in a ring in Poland. Mostly wrestlers, but also other in-ring personnel such as referees and ring announcers. It is derived from the events database.

Links typeset in _italics_ are aliases used by a character besides their current name or gimmick, and are listed after their most recently used name. Names that are not links represent talent that doesn't have a dedicated page yet.

Each name is followed by a list of organizations they appeared for, represented by their logos. If that name appears in less than 5 matches, numbered links to events will be added after each organization logo.
