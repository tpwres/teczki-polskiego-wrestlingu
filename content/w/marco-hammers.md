## Professional wrestling career 

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2020-2021)

Marco made his first steps in a wrestling ring in a [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) academy, but he has never made a official professional debut in a federation, as he left KPW in 2021.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

#### Debut and early feuds

Marco Hammers made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [PTW Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md), where he made his apperance in a PTW contract Battle Royal Match. He rocked a heel persona obsessed with his masculinity and embracing his baldness. He was unsucessful in winning his first match and securing kayfabe contract, as the match was won by [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md). At the [next Underground](@/e/ptw/2023-01-28-ptw-underground-10.md) show he appeared once again and managed to defeat [El Ogre](@/w/olgierd.md) to win such contract. He continued to make regular appearances in singles matches throughout his involvement in a feud against PAKA.

#### Formation of Legia Łysych

After debut of another bald villain - [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - Marco was quickly paired with him and a kayfabe girlfriend/valet of Olgierd - Karyna - to form a tag team called Legia Łysych (roughly Legion of the Bald, but heavily leaning into Polish football fan scene - Legia is the name of Warsaw's football team). They quickly got involved in a feud between Pure Gold ([Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md)) against babyface stable PAKA ([Taras](@/w/taras.md), [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and [Boro](@/w/boro.md)). Despite the fact, that the villains outnumbered PAKA in a feud, the babyfaces managed to win [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md), which led to a frustration from Pure Gold side. After a defeat in a Six-Man Tag Team Match against PAKA at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) Gabriel turned on incopetent hooligans, which led to a duology of Singles Matches against Legia Łysych. Gabirel managed to defeat both on them. 

At [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) Legia Łysych ultimatevly got rid of Karyna due to fact, that she refused to go bald to match Legia Łysych hairdo. When she has no-showed Marco and Olgierd have decided to shave someone else instead: the victim was supposed to be [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md). He was rescued by Marcin Najman - an Polish ex-boxer and freakfighter, who attacked Legia Łysych and have beaten up both of them. 

#### PTW Intergender Champion

After Gold Rush Marco started a programme with [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) - the sole full-time Polish female wrestler in PTW. Due to his high masculinity level and misogyny he taunted Diana, and crowned himself [PTW Intergender Champion](@/c/ptw-intergender-championship.md) after defeating her in a Intergender Match at [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md). He rocked a custom made cardboard belt and proudly depicted it as official title in PTW, despite [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) disagreement. This rivalry progressed into Intergender Tag Team Match at [PTW #6: Total Blast To The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), where Legia Łysych defeated Diana Strong and Heidi Katrina. This match marked Marco's last apperance in Prime Time Wrestling, as he took part in [PTW's talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in June 2024. 

### PpW Ewenement (2024-)

#### Zmowa

Olgierd and Hammers, teaming together as Legia Łysych joined to PpW during [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), in a surprise appearance, answering a challenge laid out by Pure Gold. While Pure Gold were taunting Legia on their social media channels before the event, fans didn't take this for anything but a provocation against PTW. Legia, up until the very last moment, appeared to remain committed to PTW, themselves feuding with [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) and defending PTW Intergender Championship. They were victorious in their unexpected debut, and an official confirmation of joining the PpW roster followed soon. Shortly after his return to PpW he joined ["Zmowa"](@/a/the-collusion.md), a villainous faction led by Mister Z, fighting against PpW's top babyfaces both in tag team & in solo action.

He was a part of Zmowa team in a Ustawka Match at [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), where he was eliminated as the first one by [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md).

During the [PpW Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md) non-canon show he brought over his PTW Intergender Championship and briefly lost it to Istotna Martynka - co-host of YouTube's channel "Istota Wrestlingu" - but he has managed to retain it the same night.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

In October 2024 Marco Hammers made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at the [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) show, where he faced and got defeated by another ex-PTW wrestler [Samson](@/w/samson.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

#### Feud with Filip Fux

Marco Hammers was seen as one of the characters in a first trailers for new wrestling project in Poland - [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md). In one of episodes of his YouTube vlog series - "Łysy Vlog" - he got into conflict with KPW wrestler [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) over a creatine during their joint trip to Hungary for a HCW show. This internet feud evolved into a match at Legacy's [first ever show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). Marco won this match after Olgierd's distraction, and in a post-match beatdown he and Olgierd have managed to snatch Filip's [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) belt and pose with it, which strongly suggested that Legia Łysych wants to face current champions for said title.
