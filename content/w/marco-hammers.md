## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2020-2022)

Marco made his first steps in a wrestling ring in the [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) academy, but he never made an official professional debut in the federation, as he left KPW in 2022.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

#### Debut and early feuds

Marco Hammers debuted in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [PTW Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md), where he appeared in a PTW Contract Battle Royal Match.
He rocked a heel persona obsessed with his masculinity and embracing his baldness.
He was unsuccessful in winning his first match and securing the kayfabe contract, which went to [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md) instead.
At the [following Underground show](@/e/ptw/2023-01-28-ptw-underground-10.md), Marco appeared once again and managed to defeat [El Ogre](@/w/olgierd.md) to win the contract. He continued to make regular appearances in singles matches throughout his involvement in a feud with [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md).

#### Formation of Legia Łysych

After the debut of another bald villain, [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), Marco was quickly paired with him and a kayfabe girlfriend/valet of Olgierd - Karyna - to form a tag team called Legia Łysych (roughly _Legion of the Bald_, but leaning heavily into the Polish football scene - [Legia][legia-warszawa] is the name of Warsaw's football team, whose colours were borrowed by the tag team).
They quickly got involved in a feud between Pure Gold ([Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md)) and the babyface stable PAKA ([Taras](@/w/taras.md), [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and [Boro](@/w/boro.md)).
Despite the fact that the villains outnumbered PAKA in the feud, the babyfaces managed to win the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md), which frustrated Pure Gold.
After losing in a Six-Man Tag Team Match against PAKA at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md), Gabriel turned on the incompetent hooligans, which led to a pair of Singles Matches against Legia Łysych, in which Gabriel managed to defeat both.

At [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) Legia Łysych ultimately got rid of Karyna when she refused to shave her head to match the group's mandatory hairstyle.
When she no-showed the event, Marco and Olgierd decided to shave someone else instead: the victim was supposed to be [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md).
He was rescued by Marcin Najman - a Polish ex-boxer and freakfighter, who attacked Legia Łysych and beat up both of them.

#### PTW Intergender Champion

After Gold Rush, Marco started a programme with [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) - the sole full-time Polish female wrestler in PTW.
As a self-proclaimed misogynist and narcissistic hyper-masculine heel, he taunted Diana with sexist remarks, and later crowned himself the [PTW Intergender Champion](@/c/ptw-intergender-championship.md) after defeating her in an Intergender Match at [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md).
This championship was a DIY cardboard belt, nevertheless he claimed it to be an official title in PTW, despite [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) disagreeing.
This rivalry progressed into an Intergender Tag Team Match at [PTW #6: Total Blast To The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), where Diana Strong and British wrestler Heidi Katrina lost to the bald men again.
Ultimately, this was Marco's final appearance in Prime Time Wrestling, as he was part of the [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in June 2024.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Zmowa

Olgierd and Hammers, teaming together as Legia Łysych, joined PpW in a surprise appearance at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), answering a challenge issued by Pure Gold.
While Pure Gold taunted Legia on their social media channels before the event, fans didn't take this as anything but a provocation against PTW.
Legia, up until the very last moment, appeared to remain committed to PTW, feuding with [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) and defending the PTW Intergender Championship.
They were victorious in their unexpected debut, and an official confirmation of joining the PpW roster followed soon.
Shortly after his joining PpW, Marco joined ["Zmowa"](@/tt/zmowa.md), a villainous faction led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), feuding against PpW's top babyfaces both in tag team and solo matches.

Marco was a part of the Zmowa team in an Ustawka Match at [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), where he was the first one to be eliminated.

During the non-canon show [PpW Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md), Hammers brought over his PTW Intergender Championship and briefly lost it to Istotna Martynka - co-host of the YouTube channel "Istota Wrestlingu" - but managed to regain it the same night.

#### Growing delusion

Despite Zmowa's defeat at Co Za Noc, Marco remained in the stable, often facing PpW's babyfaces and helping out both Mister Z and Olgierd achieve their goals. Despite that he grew more and more delusional, trying to portray himself as a hardcore wrestler and a daredevil high-flyer (despite having a crippling fear of heights). At [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) he entered the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) #1 Contender Ladder Match with an entrance and moveset inspired by Jeff Hardy. He was unsucessful in that match, but in a post-match interview he confessed to [Joker](@/w/joker.md) that he feels scared of himself due to the fact that during the match he performed a shocking Swanton Bomb onto [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), effecitvely murdering his opponent (in his own mind). This angle led to Marco adopting the nickname "Marco Hardy" as a tribute to his idol. Occasionally PpW honors that nickname, though in a tongue-in-cheek manner.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-present)

In October 2024 Marco Hammers made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), where he faced and was defeated by another ex-PTW wrestler, [Samson](@/w/samson.md). At [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) Legia Łysych took on [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and an MZW veteran [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) in a victorious Tag Team Match.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Feud with Filip Fux

Marco Hammers was seen as one of the characters in the first trailer for a new wrestling project in Poland: [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md).
In one of the episodes of his YouTube vlog series - "Łysy Vlog" - he got into a conflict with KPW wrestler [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) over some muscle-enhancing creatine, which Filip supposedly stole from Marco during their joint trip to Hungary for an HCW show.
This Internet feud evolved into a match at Legacy's [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md).
Marco won this match after Olgierd's distraction, and in a post-match beatdown him and Olgierd managed to snatch Filip's [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) belt and pose with it, which strongly suggested Legia's intention to face the KPW champions for their titles.

This came to fruition at the [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), when Marco and Olgierd faced the Fux Brothers for their [KPW Tag Team Championships](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) in the main event, but they were unable to defeat them.

## International wrestling appearances 

Marco started taking international bookings in 2022. That year he made a few appearances for Austrian Rings of Europe, as well as for BODYSLAM! Pro Wrestling in Denmark. From 2023 onwards he, along with his tag team partner [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), took more bookings, most notably for German and Hungarian federations such as Eastside Revolution Wrestling and Passion Pro Wrestling.
