Krycha made his debut in the Głuchołazy-based backyard federation [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) around mid-2011. Not much information is available from that time, however it is confirmed that during his PXW days he made at least six appearances. He also won the PXW Championship at least one time, as well as the ECW Championship, which he won from Razor. He made his last known apperance in PXW at [Summer Fights 2011](@/e/pxw/2011-08-20-pxw-summer-fights-2011.md) and seemingly retired from wrestling.

Krycha's ring name was unusual and unique on the Polish scene, as it was an augmentative form of the feminine name Krystyna - despite the wrestler being male.
