## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2016-2018)

Today's Olgierd debuted as Hades in PpW back in 2016, when the organization was merely a backyard wrestling project.
During his two-year run, he competed against the likes of [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md),
[Feager](@/w/feager.md) or [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md).
At that time, as a member of the "Hardcore Friday" roster, his specialty was hardcore matches.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling and occasionally PpW (2018-2021)

Olgierd started training in Maniac Zone Wrestling's academy in 2018, joining their summer camp in Wrocław, and suspending his PpW membership.
In late 2018 and early 2019, he was one of the founding members of [The Greens](@/a/the-greens.md).
Officially debuting at [Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) in a Rookie Battle Royal, he was eliminated by Ring Rat (later to become [Ref Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md)).
As Krueger, he also appeared at [Project 7: Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md) and the pandemic-era [Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md) recordings.
His last appearance was at [Project 8: Golden Road Finals](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md), facing against [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) and Deti Black in a Triple Threat Match.

After a couple of months, on October 29th 2021, Olgierd officially quit MZW, during the so-called "Green Revolution", when multiple talent left the organization on the very same day. Aside from Olgierd, they were [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md), [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md), [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md).

### First return to PpW (2021)

Thanks to the pandemic-induced break in MZW's schedule, Olgierd was able to return to PpW for two appearances. The first one was at [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) as Hades in a hardcore match against [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), and in several showcase matches at [Poznań Supershow](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut

The former Hades joined the newly created [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) soon after leaving MZW, and continued his training with them.
He debuted at [PTW Underground 13](@/e/ptw/2023-03-26-ptw-underground-13.md), facing the veteran [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), adopting the gimmick of Olgierd, a hard-headed hooligan ready to fight anybody at a moment's notice.

#### Formation of Legia Łysych

This new character was quickly paired with [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), and a valet/kayfabe girlfriend Karyna, into a team named "Legia Łysych" (roughly _Legion of the Bald_, but heavily leaning into Polish football fan scene - Legia is the name of Warsaw's football team).
Again he was able to show his prowess in hardcore-style matches - two of his top bouts were Street Fights, one against [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) at [Underground 17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md), and another, Christmas-themed street fight against [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md).
Besides that, Olgierd was one of the participants of the [Gold Rush Rumble](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), where the winner became PTW's inaugural singles champion. As Legia with Marco, they co-main evented [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) in an Intergender Tag Team Match against [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) and British wrestler Heidi Katrina.

After Total Blast From The Past, Olgierd, Marco and numerous other talent [left PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md), but choose not to make that information public right away.

### Second return to PpW (2024-present)

#### Return as Olgierd & joining "Zmowa"

Olgierd and Hammers, teaming together as Legia Łysych returned to PpW during [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), in a surprise appearance, answering a challenge laid out by Pure Gold ([Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)).
While Pure Gold were taunting Legia on their social media channels before the event, fans didn't take this for anything but a provocation against PTW.
Legia, up until the very last moment, appeared to remain committed to PTW, themselves feuding with [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) and defending a joke "[Intergender Championship](@/c/ptw-intergender-championship.md)" belt made of cardboard.
They were victorious in their unexpected debut, and an official confirmation of joining the PpW roster followed soon.
Shortly after his return to PpW he joined ["Zmowa"](@/a/the-collusion.md), a villainous faction led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), fighting against PpW's top babyfaces both in tag team & in solo action.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

In October 2024 he - alongside [Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) - had returned to [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at their show [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), which marked the first time since 2021 when members of ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md) made their appearance an an MZW show.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

In November 2024 it was announced that Olgierd would face [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) in a "PpW Rules Match" at [Legacy of Wrestling's](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). He was defeated by Biesiad in that match.
