## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-)

#### Debut 

Krampus made his first apperance on Polish wrestling scene in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), at their [second Underground](@/e/ptw/2022-01-23-ptw-underground-2.md) show. From the start he was portrayed as a villainous powerhouse with a dark gimmick inspired by an Austrian folklore character: Krampus. From his debut onwards he kept his winning streak over wrestlers such as [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Marty Scurll](@/w/marty-scurll.md).

#### Sinister Kingdom

At [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) Krampus was involved in a Last Man Standing Match between [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). Krampus attacked Nano and put him through the commentary table, which allowed Sinister to score a victory. After that the Austrian powerhouse bowed to Sinister, joining him as his enforcer. 

After defeating Peter Tihanyi at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), Krampus helped Sinister in recruiting another acolyte to Sinister Kingdom: [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md). He then continued to help Sinister in his ventures, most notably in a rivalry against Nano Lopez. The Spanish wrestler had the opportunity to face Krampus in a Singles Match at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), but he was unable to defeat him. At the same show Krampus was set to enter the Gold Rush Rumble, but was prevented from doing so by Nano, who attacked and abducted Sinister, forcing Krampus to forfeit his Rumble appearance and chase after his master. 

At [PTW #6: Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) Krampus and Dziedzic got involved in a main event between [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) and Babathunder, where they attacked both competitors and caused it to be ruled as no-contest. This angle was percieved very negatively by the fans, which added more problems to already criticised show. Ultimatevly, after the Total Blast and huge [PTW's talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md), which included Dziedzic and Sinister, the angle was ultimately scrapped. 

#### Return to singles competition

After losing his stable, Krampus returned to singles competition in PTW with a rather part-time schedule. He made an apperance at [Walczymy Dla Fundacji](@/e/ptw/2024-09-29-ptw-walczymy-dla-fundacji.md) charity show. He defeated Newt Nova and [Erik Šlotíř](@/w/erik-slotir.md) in a Triple Threat Match.

## Other ventures

Besides his apperances in Prime Time Wrestling, Krampus was also the booker of World Wrestling Austria (WWA) project, which was active from September 2023 to October 2024. They managed to produce three events and ensure a partnership with PTW itself, which led to WWA's conversion into PTW:WWA - a "sister promotion" of the Polish federation. They even promoted their own PTW:WWA Championship and PTW:WWA Tag Team Championship. The first one was won by Puncher, who defeated Marius Al-Ani. After PTW:WWA's third show the promotion seemingly shut down.
