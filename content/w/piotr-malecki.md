## Professional wrestling career

### Pro wrestling content creator (2015-present)

Piotr Małecki started his involvement in Polish wrestling scene as a internet content creator involved in numerous projects focused on professional wrestling. He was a part of numerous news websites and YouTube channels, with the most notorious being MyWrestling, Głos Wrestlingu and What is Wrestling. In his early years he mainly focused on presenting materials regarding international circuit, but he also sometimes created various materials about polish wrestling scene. 

ShowOff continued his activity as a content creator on a rather regular basis up until 2021. After that year his activity in that branch of entertaiment began to decline, as he began to pull out of his activity in various endeavours besides "Głos Wrestlingu" to focus more on his other activity on wrestling scene.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016; 2021)

In 2016 ShowOff along with his co-editor from MyWrestling news website - Marcel Koniecki - made his debut in a commentator role at [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md) show. His commentary track was even included in DVD-release of said show.

Piotr returned to MZW to make yet another apperance as a commentator in early 2021, when he - along with Jędrzej Jezierski - performed a commentary for [second](@/e/mzw/2021-04-09-mzw-project-basement-2.md) and [third](@/e/mzw/2021-04-30-mzw-project-basement-3.md) episodes of MZW Project Basement.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

Piotr "ShowOff" Małecki made his debut as a [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) commentator at [Underground 4](@/e/ptw/2022-04-24-ptw-underground-4.md) in April 2022, where he worked mainly in a role of color commentator. He often worked with either [Arkadiusz Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) or [Łukasz Baliński](@/w/lukasz-balinski.md). Throughout 2022 and 2023 he evolved into commentator with most regular apperances, especially in 2023, where he worked on most Underground shows. After PTW launched their special Q&A livestreams for channel supporters ShowOff became one of the hosts of the programme along with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), he also got involved in working alongside Pawłowski in a unspecified backstage creative role.

After some time ShowOff's relations with federation began to sour, as he felt burnt out. He mentioned that fact in his instagram post shortly after the last show he commentated for PTW: [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md). In the same post he announced his [departure](@/a/ptw-exits.md) from Prime Time Wrestling.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

On the 14th of August 2024 a reveal trailer was posted to a new YouTube channel named [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md). Couple days later LOW held a live Q&A on YouTube with ShowOff as the "spokesman" of federation and it became clear, that he is somewhat involved in being a part of creative team of said federation to some degree. 

Piotr was present in person at [first LOW show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), where he took part in [Disco Pablo's](@/w/disco-pablo.md) musical chairs segment. ShowOff was introduced by Pablo as "member of LOW personnel who make that show happen". During said segment he got attacked by [Taras](@/w/taras.md) - ex-PAKA member - who assaulted Pablo, and put Piotr through a table.
