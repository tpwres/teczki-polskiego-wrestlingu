## Professional wrestling career

### Pro wrestling content creator (2015-present)

Piotr Małecki started his involvement in Polish wrestling scene as an Internet content creator, involved in several projects focused on professional wrestling. He wrote and appeared for numerous news websites and YouTube channels, with the most notable being MyWrestling, Głos Wrestlingu and What is Wrestling. In his early years he mainly focused on the international circuit, but occasionally created content about the Polish wrestling scene as well.

ShowOff continued his activity as a content creator on a rather regular basis up until 2021. After that year his activity in that area started to decline, as he began to pull out of his activity in various endeavours besides "Głos Wrestlingu", in order to focus more on his other activities on the wrestling scene.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016; 2021)

In 2016 ShowOff - along with his co-editor from MyWrestling news website, Marcel Koniecki - made his debut in a commentator role at [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md). His commentary track was even included on the DVD release of said show.

Piotr returned to MZW to make yet another appearance as a commentator in the early 2021, when he, along with Jędrzej Jezierski, commentated the [second](@/e/mzw/2021-04-09-mzw-project-basement-2.md) and [third](@/e/mzw/2021-04-30-mzw-project-basement-3.md) episodes of MZW Project Basement.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

Piotr Małecki made his debut as a [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) commentator at [Underground 4](@/e/ptw/2022-04-24-ptw-underground-4.md) in April 2022, working mainly  as color commentator. He often worked with either [Arkadiusz Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) or [Łukasz Baliński](@/w/lukasz-balinski.md). Throughout 2022 and 2023 he made the most regular appearances of all the PTW commentators, especially in 2023, when he did commentary for most of the Underground shows. After PTW launched their special Q&A livestreams for their YouTube channel supporters, ShowOff became one of the hosts of the programme along with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). He also got involved in working alongside Pawłowski in an unspecified backstage creative role.

After some time ShowOff's relations with the federation began to sour, as he felt burnt out. He mentioned that fact in an Instagram post shortly after [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), the last PTW show he commentated. In the same post he announced his [departure](@/a/ptw-exits.md) from Prime Time Wrestling.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

On the 14th of August 2024 a reveal trailer was posted to a new YouTube channel named [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md). A couple of days later LOW held a live Q&A on YouTube with ShowOff as the "spokesman" of the federation, and it became clear that he is involved in the creative team of the federation, to some degree.

Piotr was present in person at the [first Legacy show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), where he took part in [Disco Pablo's](@/w/disco-pablo.md) musical chairs segment. ShowOff was introduced by Pablo as "a member of LOW personnel who made that show happen". During that segment Piotr was attacked by [ex-PTW Tag Team Champion](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) [Taras](@/w/taras.md), who assaulted his former PAKA Tag-Team partner Pablo, and put Piotr through a table.
