## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2019-2023)

#### Debut as Duende

Borys made his debut in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) as a masked luchador Duende at [PpW Dark Show](@/e/ppw/2019-09-27-ppw-dark-show.md) where he faced [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md). He then made a few other appearances during PpW's early professional shows before switching to a refereeing role.

#### Referee

Borys continued his appearances in PpW as a referee from [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) up to [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md), with a nine-month absence between [Piwa i Igrzysk](@/e/ppw/2023-03-11-ppw-piwa-i-igrzysk.md) and Turbo OG. For this time he mostly worked as the main and sole referee, before being joined by [Referee Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md) from [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) onwards. After Turbo OG he quietly resigned from working in PpW. However, he is sometimes seen during PpW shows hosted in [2KOŁA](@/v/2kola.md) being one of the barmen.
