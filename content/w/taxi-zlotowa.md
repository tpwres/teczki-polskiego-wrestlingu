## Professional wrestling career

### Microinfluencer in training

TAXI Złotówa is one of the Polish microinfluencers who became best known for his career in freak fights in MMA federations where [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) was doing the duties of ring announcer and host, and where he met Złotówa. He was one of the project-wrestlers of Pan Pawłowski. During the early days of [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) Arkadiusz tried to attract many niche influencers to wrestling in order to grow both their careers, help PTW's media presence and build audience interest. Złotówa was one of the influencers who managed to continue his pro-wrestling training for some time.

### Feud with Pawłowski

TAXI Złotówa made his debut at PTW's first official show, [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he quickly defeated Marcel Budzianowski, who would be later called [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md). Złotówa was portrayed as a comedy heel character who demanded a fight with well-known influencers such as [Mariusz Pudzianowski][pudzian], and called Pawłowski a con man for constantly tricking him. He then tried to attack Pawłowski at [Underground 2](@/e/ptw/2022-01-23-ptw-underground-2.md), but his offensive was repelled by PTW's owner. Złotówa was subsequently suspended from PTW, which led him to make desperate attempts to get his job back. Shortly after that Złotówa had stopped making regular appearances at [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md).

His next appearance at a PTW show was in the role of a hired private security guard of [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) at [PTW #2: Blackout](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md). During the match of his employer against Joe Hendry, he got involved by carelessly hitting Joe with a low blow right in front of [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), which caused many controversies. However Gabriel lost his match despite the help from Złotówa, and fired him from his role as security guard.

He made yet another appearance in a segment at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), where he was wearing a penguin mascot costume - that of Kinguin, PTW's sponsor. He managed to enter the ring and ask Pawłowski to reinstate him, but the request was denied, and Złotówa was dragged out by security personnel.

Złotówa made his last appearance over a year later at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he entered the Gold Rush Rumble Match for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), but was eliminated by Marcelito - the very same man whom he had defeated in his debut.
