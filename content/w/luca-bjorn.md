## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2024-present)

Luca Bjorn made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [PTW x RyuCon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md) where he faced Maverick, [Blaze](@/w/blaze.md) and [Rust](@/w/rust.md) in a Fatal Four Way Match for a PTW contract. He was defeated in that bout, but nonetheless continued to make further, regular appearances in the federation. During his stint in PTW he adapted a villainous Viking persona.

In December 2024, at [Underground 25](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), Luca and Rust together, as [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md) (their tag team on the Italian scene since 2019) challenged Budapest Bastards for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). They managed to score a victory over [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md) and [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md), thus becoming the third PTW Tag Team Champions in history.
