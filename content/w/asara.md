## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2022-current)

Asara was one of three Czech wrestlers making their PpW debut at [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md), alongside [Skull Evil](@/w/skull-evil.md) and Viking. At that event he faced Skull Evil, winning by disqualification. His appearance was well received by the fans.

Since then, Asara returned once every following year, facing wrestlers like [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Samson](@/w/samson.md) in a Three Way Dance, and most recently [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) as an unannounced entrant in a Gauntlet Match.
