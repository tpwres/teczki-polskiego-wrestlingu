### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-present)

#### Debut and injury

Spartan made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 8](@/e/ptw/2022-09-25-ptw-underground-8.md) where he defeated [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md). He was portrayed as babyface powerhouse persona with gimmick and attire highly influenced by spartan warriors. At [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md) he defeated [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md). Later on during [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) he teased a possible feud with [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), but the plan was eventually held off while Spartan has been injured during training.

#### Return and championship pursuit

Spartan returned over a year later during [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he was one of the entrants in Gold Rush Rumble Match for [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). He eliminated Wiktor Longman and was able to make it to the final four, before being eliminated by James Storm. After [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md) he was one of few wrestlers who remained in federation, and become one of most pushed babyfaces in the company. He managed to held his undefeated streak, which included defeating Aaron Williams for #1 contender spot for PTW Championship. He faced [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) for said championship, but during the match he was betrayed by heel-turning [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) who striked him with a chair to secure Puncher's win.
