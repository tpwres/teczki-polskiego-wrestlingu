## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-present)

#### Debut and injury

Spartan made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 8](@/e/ptw/2022-09-25-ptw-underground-8.md) where he defeated [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md). He was portrayed as a babyface powerhouse persona with the gimmick and attire highly influenced by Spartan warriors. At [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md) he defeated [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md). Later on during [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) he teased a possible feud with [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), but the plan was eventually shelved while Spartan had been injured during training.

#### Return and championship pursuit

Spartan returned over a year later during [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he was one of the entrants in the Gold Rush Rumble Match for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). He eliminated Wiktor Longman and was able to make it to the final four, before being eliminated by James Storm. After a wave of[wrestler exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md) he was one of the few wrestlers who remained in the federation, and became one of the most pushed babyfaces in the company. He managed to keep his undefeated streak, which included defeating Aaron Williams for the #1 contender spot for the PTW Championship. He faced [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) for said championship, but during the match he was betrayed by GM [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) who, as part of a heel turn, struck him with a chair to secure Puncher's win.

#### Alliance against Pawłowski

Pawłowski's heel turn caused Spartan to step onto a war path with the villainous General Manager. He allied himself with PTW's co-owner, [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), to fend off both Arkadiusz and the members of his new stable, [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) (_The Untouchables_), consisting of Pawłowski, Puncher and [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md) - a team of [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md). They feuded for the next few shows with Spartan trying to lay his hands on Puncher. 

At [Halloweenowa Rozpierducha](@/e/ptw/2025-10-25-ptw-halloweenowa-rozpierducha.md) Team Okoński faced Nietykalni in an Elimination Tag Team Match, with one of the stakes of the match being the possibility of a Championship opportunity for Spartan. However, during the match [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) betrayed his teammates by striking Spartan with a chair, allowing Nietyklani to score a victory. Spartan's ban didn't last long, as at PTW's [next show](@/e/ptw/2025-11-15-ptw-totalna-anihilacja.md) Okoński faced Pan Pawłowski and Puncher in a Three Stages of Hell Match, which he won and once again allowed Spartan to face Puncher for the PTW Championship at [Świąt Nie Będzie](@/e/ptw/2025-12-13-ptw-swiat-nie-bedzie.md).

## International wrestling appearances

In addition to his work in Poland, Spartan also made a few appearances on the Hungarian wrestling scene, most notably in HCW. He also worked a few shows in Austria and Italy, for PTW-affiliated Wrestling World Austria and BestYa Wrestling.
