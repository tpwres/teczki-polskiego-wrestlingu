He eliminated Wiktor Longman and was able to make it to the final four, before being eliminated by James Storm. After [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md) he was one of the few wrestlers who remained in the federation, and become one of the most pushed babyfaces in the company. He managed to hold his undefeated streak, which included defeating Aaron Williams for the #1 contender spot for the PTW Championship. He faced [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) for said championship, but during the match he was betrayed by the heel-turning [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) who struck him with a chair to secure Puncher's win.
