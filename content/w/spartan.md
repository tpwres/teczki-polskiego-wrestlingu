## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-present)

#### Debut and injury

Spartan made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 8](@/e/ptw/2022-09-25-ptw-underground-8.md) where he defeated [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md). He was portrayed as a babyface powerhouse persona with the gimmick and attire highly influenced by Spartan warriors. At [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md) he defeated [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md). Later on during [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) he teased a possible feud with [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), but the plan was eventually shelved while Spartan had been injured during training.

#### Return and championship pursuit

Spartan returned over a year later during [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he was one of the entrants in the Gold Rush Rumble Match for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). He eliminated Wiktor Longman and was able to make it to the final four, before being eliminated by James Storm. After a wave of[wrestler exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md) he was one of the few wrestlers who remained in the federation, and became one of the most pushed babyfaces in the company. He managed to keep his undefeated streak, which included defeating Aaron Williams for the #1 contender spot for the PTW Championship. He faced [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) for said championship, but during the match he was betrayed by GM [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) who, as part of a heel turn, struck him with a chair to secure Puncher's win.

Besides his appearances in Polish wrestling, Spartan also made a few appearances on the Hungarian wrestling scene, most notably in HCW.
