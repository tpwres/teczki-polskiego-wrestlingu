## Professional wrestling career

### Internet personality: Istota Wrestlingu (2023-)

In 2023, Martyna and her husband [Istociarz](@/w/istociarz.md) started a YouTube channel called Istota Wrestlingu (roughly _The Essence of Wrestling_) where they talked about the recent shows by various Polish promotions. As the channel grew, they started inviting wrestlers and other personalities from the Polish wrestling scene for interviews. At the same time they moved away from the pre-recorded format in favour of live streams, at which point they started wearing their trademark cat-like lucha libre masks.

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling trainee (2024-present)

Istotna Martynka joined [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) at some point in 2024. She made her first - albeit unofficial - appearance in the ring at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md). On the first day of the show she accompanied other wrestlers as Siostra Kimono (_Sister Kimono_), and on the third day she fought in three matches - first winning the [PTW Intergender Championship](@/c/ptw-intergender-championship.md) from [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), then losing it back to him, and finally taking part in a Battle Royal.
