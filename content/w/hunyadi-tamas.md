## Professional wrestling career 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2023)

Hunyadi Tamas made his debut in Poland for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) in October 2022, where he was one of the contenders in a Contract Battle Royal at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md), which was won by [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md). He made his return for next Underground shows, working at total of 6 PTW's shows with [Underground 15](@/e/ptw/2023-05-28-ptw-underground-15.md) being the final one. He was portrayed as babyface "hungarian soldier" persona, and for most of his appearances he served as enhancement talent. He managed to score one victory over [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md). 

At his final show - Underground 15 - he was a part of a storyline between [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) and [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) - Hunyadi's friend and Tag Team partner. After their match Puncher brutally attacked Tamas busting him open in the process to send a message towards Robert. This marks Hunyadi final appearance for PTW.
