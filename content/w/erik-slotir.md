## Professional wrestling career 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-2025)

Not long after his debut in the Czech federation VcV Original Wrestling, Šlotíř debuted in Poland. In 2023 he appeared at [PTW Underground 16](e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16/), in a losing effort against [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md). He quickly entered a feud with [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md), whom he took out and replaced in a match against [King Kaiden](@/w/king-kaiden.md) at [PTW Underground 17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md).

In time, Šlotíř became a mainstay in PTW, primarily working Undergrounds as a midcard wrestler. His debut at a larger PTW show came at [PTW#5: Gold Rush](e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), where he was eliminated from the Gold Rush Rumble Match by [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md). Over the next months, he competed in mid-card matches against a variety of opponents, but never got involved in major storylines. 

In 2025, Šlotíř entered the tournament for newly created [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), but came up short, losing in quarter-finals at [Wrestlingowe Walentynki](@/e/ptw/2025-02-15-ptw-wrestlingowe-walentynki.md). The following week, Šlotíř announced his departure from PTW via an Instagram story. PTW confirmed this in Facebook comments, calling Šlotíř's departure "semi-retirement", with PTW leaving ther doors open for a return.

Fans often called Šlotíř "Krecik", which is the Polish title of the Czechoslovakian (and later Czech) cartoon known in English as ["The Little Mole"][krtek].
