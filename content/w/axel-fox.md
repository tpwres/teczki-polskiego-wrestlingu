## Professional wrestling career

### Before 2017: pro wrestling content creator

Appearing simply as "Amisz" (his forum nickname) or under his real name Kuba (a variant of _Jacob_), he began his wrestling-related activies as a journalist, writing articles and discussing the indy wrestling scene abroad.
He also ran his own YouTube channel called "KGWrestlingPodcast", where he also covered similar topics (most notably Pro Wrestling Guerilla).

### 2017: DFW debut and training

In early 2017 he was involved in the "What Is Wrestling" YouTube channel, along with Mikita "Seth Donner" Varanovich, and later PTW commentator Piotr "ShowOff" Małecki.
During that time, the WiW team was involved in a storyline with [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md), which concluded in Amisz's first pro wrestling match at [Recent Dreams](@/e/dfw/2017-04-23-dfw-recent-dreams.md) where he faced [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md).
At sometime during that period, Amisz started regular pro wrestling training at [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md)'s academy in Głuchołazy. In his proper first match for MZW, he was against [Hexia](@/w/hexia.md) and [Mr B.](@/w/mr-b.md) in a squash match at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md).

### 2018-2020: MZW and Germany

Amisz continued his training under [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md). At [Project 1](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) he debuted his new "Axel Fox" gimmick.
He quickly became one of MZW's most regular wrestlers, appearing on every show since the organization moved permanently to Wrocław.
Fox made a couple of appearances on the German indy scene, in Next Step Wrestling and Unlimited Wrestling (who often cooperated with MZW back then).
His final appearance for MZW was at [Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md).
Since late 2018-early 2019 he was one of the founding members of "Zieloni" (_The Greens_) social group, which later evolved into a backstage group active on the Polish pro wrestling scene.

### 2021-2024 PTW and European Expansion

Fox left MZW in early 2021, having not appeared at the tapings for [Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md).
Later that year, along with some other "Greens", he joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), becoming one of the most prominent babyfaces and workhorses of the organization, appearing on almost every show produced by the companyy.
His most notable storyline was the one involving [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), his mentor and friend turned rival.
This was one of the most important feuds in PTW's golden era (between [Blackout](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md) and [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md)), which culminated in one of the top rated matches on the Polish scene at the latter show.
After that match, he formed a tag team with now-babyface Justin, to participate at the PTW Tag Team Championship Tournament, as "FoxJoy". The team made it to semi-finals where they lost to Pure Gold ([Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md)).
The team was dissolved soon after the tournament, as Joy has left PTW later that year.

In early 2024, Axel Fox was involved as one of the contenders at the [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) Royal Rumble match, where he was one of the final two competitors with [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), the final winner.

During his tenure in PTW, Axel become one of the most active Polish pro wrestlers on the European indy scene, making regular appearances in Germany for wXw Academy, wXw itself and That's Awesome Wrestling; in Austria for Rings of Europe and the PTW-associated WWA; and in Hungary for HCW and Passion Pro Wrestling.

He also became a part-time coach, training others at the PTW Performance Center.
