## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2012)

Szymon Siwiec debuted as "Mr. Fitness" in a Polish backyard federation called ["Polish Xtreme Wrestling"](@/o/pxw.md) back in August 2012. The organization was based in his hometown of Głuchołazy. His ringname, as well as his whole gimmick, was based on his rather big size, which stood against his "Fitness" approach in the ring. He made two appearances in PXW back in August and did not appear in PXW ever since.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2017)

Szymon made his return to wrestling when [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) and [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) had brought professional wrestling to the Głuchołazy region by founding [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). Szymon joined the MZW Academy in early-to-mid 2014 and started training there for his in-ring debut.

He won his debutant Rookie Battle Royal at [MZW Wakacyjny Slam](@/e/mzw/2014-08-30-mzw-wakacyjny-slam.md). Szymon then continued his career, being one of the midcarders in the early years of MZW. He adopted a babyface persona of a laid-back, small-town lad. Throughout most of his time in MZW, he was winning most of the matches where he was leaning towards being the face underdog.

Finally, Szymon made his last appearance for Maniac Zone Wrestling at [Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md) before quietly quitting from wrestling in June 2017.

## Other media

In early 2013, a popular Polish hip-hop artist O.S.T.R. released a music video for his song "Czas Dużych Przemian" (_The Time of Great Changes_) featuring PXW wrestlers, with Mr. Fitness being one of them.

Szymon is also the main character of a short documentary titled [Amerykański Sen](@/a/american-dream.md) (_American Dream_), which focuses on his training to become a wrestler, overcoming stage fright and connecting with the audience.
