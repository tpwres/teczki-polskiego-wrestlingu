## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016-2017)

#### Szymon Kolanus

Szymon Kolanus joined [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) before 2016, starting his pro wrestling career in their academy. He made his debut at [Champions War II](@/e/mzw/2016-01-10-mzw-champions-war-2.md) in January 2016, in a Battle Royal Match. Besides that he made only one more appearance under his "Szymon Kolanus" ringname, which took place at [Revolution](@/e/mzw/2016-11-05-mzw-revolution.md).

#### Blue Thunder

In the early 2017 Szymon allied himself with a mysterious manager called Columbus, who turned Szymon's old self into a masked wrestler named "Blue Thunder".
He soon partnered with [Red Thunder](@/w/red-thunder.md) to form a team called [Storm Riders](@/tt/storm-riders.md). They managed to win the [MZW Tag Team Championship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) from [Zb√≥jnicy](@/tt/zbojnicy.md) in January 2017 at [Charity Show](@/e/mzw/2017-01-15-mzw-charity-show-2017.md).
Their reign lasted 140 days before they were defeated by Catch Connection at [Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md).
After that, Storm Riders disbanded and Blue Thunder only managed to make one more appearance, in a Battle Royal at [Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md). Since then, Blue Thunder has vanished from Polish wrestling, seemingly retiring from the business.
