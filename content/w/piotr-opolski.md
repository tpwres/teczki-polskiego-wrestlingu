## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2020-2022; 2025)

#### Career as wrestler

Piotr Opolski made his debut in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in February 2020. Along with [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) he was one of the finalists of KPW's 2019 internal competition "Serce do walki" (_Heart for combat_). After his debut in a singles match at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md), he briefly teamed up with Lesak at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md), only to return to singles matches afterwards. His career was cut short at [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19.md), when he sustained an injury that forced him to give up wrestling. 

#### Return to KPW

For 2.5 years Piotr Opolski wasn't seen at KPW in any capacity, until he made a surprise return at [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), where he took over the ring announcing duty from [Kinga Miotke](@/w/kinga-miotke.md), due to numerous "upgrades" announced by the acting chairman of KPW [Victor Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md). He lasted on his position only until the next show - [Zły Omen](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) - after which Kinga returned to her natural role.
