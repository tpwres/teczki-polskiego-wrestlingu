His carees was cut short at [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19-oko-za-oko.md), however, when he sustained an injury that forced him to give up wrestling. For 2.5 years he wasn't seen at KPW in any capacity, until he made a surprise return at [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), where he took over the ring announcing duty from [Kinga Miotke](@/w/kinga-miotke.md).
