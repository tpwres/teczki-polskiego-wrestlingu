## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

At [PTW: Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md), ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) was put in a [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) match as his "last chance for the gold" after his return. [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) offered to hand-pick a partner for him, who was revealed to be a PTW Academy rookie - Daniel Razor. The duo worked as babyfaces but failed to score the titles (which went to [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md): [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), added mid-match), however Razor gained Nano's and [L'Orda's](@/tt/l-orda.md) respect, establishing himself as a babyface.

To deflect the accusations of being Pawłowski's favorite, Razor posted a video where he clearly explained his allegiance, stating that he's grateful that Pawłowski has given him a chance, but now he is going to carve his own path.

At the [next show](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md) Razor joined the Gold Rush Rumble for the opportunity at [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) and reached final two, once again crossing paths with [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) who won the match and title shot by eliminating Razor last. 

As [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) had left PTW and vacated the Championship, the planned title match between himself and Nano Lopez was cancelled. Instead, as a runner up of the Rumble, Razor faced Nano for the vacant Championship, winning it in his third match.

In late September 2025, Bytom's official website posted a short [news piece][wrestler-from-bytom] about Daniel (in Polish), simply titled "Wrestler from Bytom".
The article focuses on Daniel's wrestling journey, from a kid fascinated with pro wrestling and playing video games, to training with PTW and debuting on [TV](@/a/wrestling-on-tv.md). PTW was quick to share it on their social media channels.
