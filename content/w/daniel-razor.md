## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Debut and early appearances

At [PTW: Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md), ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) was put in a [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) match as his "last chance for the gold" after his return. [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) offered to hand-pick a partner for him, who was revealed to be a PTW Academy rookie - Daniel Razor. The duo worked as babyfaces but failed to score the titles (which went to [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md): [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), added mid-match), however Razor gained Nano's and [L'Orda's](@/tt/l-orda.md) respect, establishing himself as a babyface.

To deflect the accusations of being Pawłowski's favorite, Razor posted a video where he clearly explained his allegiance, stating that he's grateful that Pawłowski has given him a chance, but now he is going to carve his own path.

#### PTW Underground Champion

At the [next show](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md) Razor joined the Gold Rush Rumble for a shot at the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), and managed to remain in the ring until the end, once again crossing paths with [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). But it was the Spanish wrestler who won the match and title shot by eliminating Razor.

When [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) had left PTW and vacated the Championship, the planned title match between him and Nano Lopez was cancelled.
Instead, as a runner up of the Rumble, Razor faced Nano for the vacant Championship, winning it in his third match.
In the meantime, he started calling himself "The Voice" of PTW fans, owing to the fact that he had been a regular fan not that long ago.
After successfully defending his Championship in three open challenges, his reign came to an end when he was defeated by now-villainous Nano Lopez, who bested him with the help of his new ally [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) at [Totalna Anihilacja](@/e/ptw/2025-11-15-ptw-totalna-anihilacja.md).

## Other media

In late September 2025, Bytom's official city website posted a short [news piece][wrestler-from-bytom] about Daniel (in Polish), simply titled "Wrestler from Bytom".
The article focuses on Daniel's wrestling journey, from a kid fascinated by pro wrestling and playing video games, to training with PTW and debuting on [TV](@/a/wrestling-on-tv.md). PTW was quick to share it on their social media channels.
