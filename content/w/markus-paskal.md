## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2025-)

Markus Paskal made his debut at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md) in a match against the former [KPW Tag Team Champion](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md), [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md), a fight he lost. Later at the same show he took part in a 13-Man Championship Battle Royal, where he very nearly emerged victorious. He was, however, sneakily one-upped by [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md), which gave rise to a conflict between the two. Lesak and Paskal faced off one-on-one at [Arena 31](@/e/kpw/2026-01-16-kpw-arena-31.md); the newcomer lost again, but he then employed the help of a former [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md) [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), who agreed to become his mentor and teamed up with Markus against Lesak and [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) at [Arena 32](@/e/kpw/2026-03-13-kpw-arena-32.md).
