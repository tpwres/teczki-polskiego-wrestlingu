## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2019)

Hexia made her debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in January 2015 at [Charity Show](@/e/mzw/2015-01-11-mzw-charity-show-2015.md) held in Głuchołazy. Before making her debut she trained at MZW Academy with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) as her coaches. Right from the start she was portraying a dark villain, and she often teamed up with other similar monster heels such as [Mr B.](@/w/mr-b.md) and [Zeritus](@/w/zeritus.md). For her second appearance at [Champions War](@/e/mzw/2015-05-31-mzw-champions-war.md) she was scheduled to face another Polish female wrestler, Akira. Following the match Hexia's opponent collapsed and the match was ruled as a referee stoppage. Akira was taken to a hospital, where she passed away a few days later due to a brain aneurysm no one had been aware of. The incident was widely covered in Polish media, putting some critique on MZW and wrestling in general.

Hexia continued her rather regural appearances in MZW from 2015 up until 2018. In most of the matches she worked either as a singles competitor, or teaming up with Mr B., most notably in Handicap Matches against such wrestlers as [Alex Arthur](@/w/alex-arthur.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). She was undefeated in regular matches throughout her career, with her only "losses" being disqualification. Hexia's last match took place at [Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md) in January 2018, where she took part in an [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) #1 Contender Big Rumble Match. After that she made one last in-ring appearance at [MZW Project 7](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md) where she was in a segment with [Ring Rat](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), Anatoli and [Krueger](@/w/olgierd.md), hitting Krueger with a Chokeslam 

After that show Hexia retired from in-ring competition.
