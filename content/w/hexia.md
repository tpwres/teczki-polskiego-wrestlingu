## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2019)

Hexia made her debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in January 2015 at [MZW Charity Show](@/e/mzw/2015-01-11-mzw-charity-show-2015.md) held in Głuchołazy. Before making her debut she trained at MZW Academy with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) being her coaches. Right from her start she was portraying a dark villain, and she often teamed up with other similar monster heels such as [Mr B.](@/w/mr-b.md) and [Zeritus](@/w/zeritus.md). At her second apperance she was scheduled to face another Polish female wrestler - Akira - but during the match Hexia's opponent suffered from serious injury which resulted in her passing away in hospital and the match was ruled as referee stoppage. It was later revealed that Akira passed away due to underlying diesease no one was aware of. The incident was widely covered in Polish media, putting some critique on MZW and wrestling in general.

Hexia continued her rather regural apperances in MZW from 2015 up until 2018. In most of the matches she worked either as a Singles competitor, or teaming up with Mr B., most notably in a Handicap Matches against wrestlers such as [Alex Arthur](@/w/alex-arthur.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). She was undefeated in regular matches throughout her career, with only "defeats" being caused by disqualification. Hexia's last match took place at [MZW Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md) in January 2018, where she took part in [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) #1 Contender Big Rumble Match. After that she made one last in-ring apperance during segment at [MZW Project 7](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md) where she appeared in a segment with [Ring Rat](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), Anatoli, and [Krueger](@/w/olgierd.md) hitting with Chokeslam the former one. 

After that apperance Hexia retired from in-ring competition.
