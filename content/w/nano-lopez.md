## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2019-2020)

Nano Lopez started his wrestling training in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) academy somwhere around 2019. Despite training there he never made an official debut on any KPW show and very little is known about his tenure in that federation.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-present)

#### Debut and early apperances

Nano Lopez joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) early in its development, being one of the most important workers since day one. He debuted at PTW first show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he won Battle Royal. It was announced that the winner of said match will face high-profile star in a main event of the next show. It was supposedly [Tomas "Nitro" Szabo](@/w/nitro.md), whom he faced at first-ever [Underground](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md) show. Nano Lopez quickly developed his babyface persona, which included his remarkable entrances with Chris Jericho inspired jackets with LED lights on them. He was often billed as "the best Spanish wrestler in Poland" by [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). At [PTW #2: BlackOut](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md) he faced and defeated ex-WWE and then-AEW wrestler Matt Sydal. 

#### Feud with Sinister

After BlackOut, Nano started a feud against one of the PTW's top villains at the time - Sinister. Their rivalry started at [Underground 3](@/e/ptw/2022-03-27-ptw-underground-3.md) and continued for almost the entire 2022. At [Ryucon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md) Sinister emerged victorious in a Submission Match, after he used chloroform to put the Spanish wrestler to sleep. After that he started to test Nano Lopez's willpower, by setting him up in unwinnable matches. First he made Starboy fight Pure Gold in a Handicap Match, later on he arranged a Gauntlet Match where Nano Lopez had to win to secure his contract in PTW. Lopez lost that match to Sinister himself. The Supreme Evil then tore Nano's contract, eventually firing him from the federation. After Nano got reinstated by [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) one show later, they were scheduled for a Last Man Standing Match at [PTW 3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). While the match was highly stacked in Starboy's favour, he eventually was attacked by [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md) who aligned himself with Sinister.

#### Multiple injuries

In February 2023 at [Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md) he was scheduled to face [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), but he was attacked by returning [Remo](@/w/remo.md) before the match started. This caused Nano to be sidelined for almost half a year until he returned to PTW at [PTW x RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) where he defeated [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md). 

In October he appeared at [Underground 18](@/e/ptw/2023-10-01-ptw-underground-18.md) where he adressed his another arm injury, but he promised, that he will return to defeat Sinister Kingdom.

#### Feud with Sinister Kingdom

Nano quickly recovered from his injuries to face [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md) in a preparation to his fight against [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md) at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md). He succeded in a match against Hungarian wrestler, but at Gold Rush he was ultimately defeated by Austrian powerhouse. He retaliated in a main event, when he interrupted Krampus's entrance to Gold Rush Rumble Match by holding Sinister as a hostage and demanding Krampus to leave the match. This angle seemingly ended Nano Lopez vs Sinister Kingdom feud.

#### Various feuds

At [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) Nano alligned himself with another Spanish wrestler - [King Kaiden](@/w/king-kaiden.md) - to face Starbuck and Erik Isaksen, two wrestlers who made their first apperances in Poland back in 2010 at [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md). 

Starboy was one of the few wrestlers who stayed loyal to Arkadiusz Pawłowski during and after PTW crisis and [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in Mid-2024. 

After PTW's soft reboot he continued to make regular apperances in the federation, working mostly in Singles Matches against foregin wrestlers such as [Blaze](@/w/blaze.md), Jake Omen and Newt Nova. At [PTW: Walczymy Dla Fundacji](@/e/ptw/2024-09-29-ptw-walczymy-dla-fundacji.md) he failed to win [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) from [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md).
