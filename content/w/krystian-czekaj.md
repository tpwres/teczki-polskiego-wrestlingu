## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Krystian Czekaj began his wrestling career in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in 2013, where he took on the roles of a referee and ring announcer.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-present)

Krystian officially debuted in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in August 2021 at [Arena 17](@e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md), and has been refereeing and commentating ever since.
