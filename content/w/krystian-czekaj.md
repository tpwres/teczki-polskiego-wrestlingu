Krystian Czekaj is the current referee and commentator for Kombat Pro Wrestling.
He took on both roles beginning with [Arena 17](@e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md) and has been consistently refereeing and commenting ever since.
Krystian is the only person on the Polish wrestling scene to serve such a dual duty.

He is also the only Polish referee to sell his own merchandise: a T-shirt saying _SÄ™dzia chuj_ ("Referee dick") - a reference to the crude but popular chant, often heard when the audience is dissatisfied with the ref's decisions, or his apparent lack of perception of heels' dirty tactics.
