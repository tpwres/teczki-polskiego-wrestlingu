## Professional wrestling career 

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Krystian Czekaj started his wrestling career in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in 2013, where he started making apperances as a referee and ring announcer.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-present)

Krystian officially debuted in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in August 2021 at [Arena 17](@e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md) and has been consistently refereeing and commentating ever since.
Krystian is the only person on the Polish wrestling scene to serve such a dual duty. He is also the first Polish referee to sell his own merchandise - a T-shirt saying ["Sędzia chuj"](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md). 

After [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) took over KPW as an _acting_ Chairman at [KPW Arena 27: Nowe Porządki](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md) Krystian has been demoted from his role as an in-ring referee to technical referee, with [Kinga Miotke](@/w/kinga-miotke.md) - ring announcer - stepping up to fullfill the role of sole official for that show.
