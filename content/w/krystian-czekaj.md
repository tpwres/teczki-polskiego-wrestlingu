Krystian Czekaj is the current referee and commentator for Kombat Pro Wrestling.
He took on both roles beginning with [Arena 17](@e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md) and has been consistently refereeing and commentating ever since.
Krystian is the only person on the Polish wrestling scene to serve such a dual duty.

Prior to being in KPW, he worked for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) as a referee and ring announcer between 2013 and 2015.

He is also the first Polish referee to sell his own merchandise - a T-shirt saying ["SÄ™dzia chuj"](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md).
