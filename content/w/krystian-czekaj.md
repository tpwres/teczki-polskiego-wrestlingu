## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Krystian Czekaj began his wrestling career in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in 2013, where he took on the roles of a referee and ring announcer.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-present)

Krystian officially debuted in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in August 2021 at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md), and has been refereeing and commentating ever since.
Krystian is the only person on the Polish wrestling scene to work in such a dual role. He is also the first Polish referee to sell his own merchandise - a T-shirt saying ["Sędzia chuj"](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#referee).

After [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) took over KPW as _Acting Chairman_ at [KPW Arena 27: Nowe Porządki](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), Krystian has been demoted from his role as an in-ring referee to that of a technical referee and timekeeper, with [Kinga Miotke](@/w/kinga-miotke.md) - the ring announcer since [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md) - stepping up to fill in the role of the sole official for that show. However, this only lasted for two shows and at [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md) Krystian returned to being a referee.
