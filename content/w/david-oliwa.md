## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2015)

David Oliwa made his in-ring debut as a rookie in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in March 2015 at [House Show](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md) in Gdańsk. In total he made two appearances for DDW, both in Battle Royal Matches, as shortly after his debut DDW folded its operations.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

#### Debut 

After DDW folded, David immediately joined [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), DDW's successor organization. He debuted at their show at [Gdynia Game Festival](@/e/kpw/2015-12-11-kpw-ggf.md) facing [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md). He was portrayed as babyface throughout most of his early career, facing wrestlers such as [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md) and [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md). 

#### Teaming with Ostrowski

At [Godzina Zero 2016](@/e/kpw/2016-08-13-kpw-godzina-zero-2016.md) Oliwa allied himself with Boski Ostrowski to compete against [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) and [GREG](@/w/greg.md), but lost. The two managed to get back on track after their Tag Team victory over [Mateusz Kowalski](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) at [Arena 4](@/e/kpw/2016-11-26-kpw-arena-4.md). Boski and Oliwa teamed up rather regularly up until they lost to Kawaleria at [Szlamfest](@/e/kpw/2017-02-04-kpw-szlamfest.md) in February 2017.

#### Feud with Kawaleria

After losing at Szlamfest, David entered into rivalry against the villainous faction Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_). Besides facing them in a Tag Team Match along with [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md) at [Arena 7](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7.md), Oliwa often faced them in multi-man matches for championship opportunites, such as [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) #1 Contendership Six Man Elimination Match at [Arena 6](@/e/kpw/2017-04-08-kpw-arena-6.md) and Magnificent Seven No Disqualification Elimination Ladder Match at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md). At [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9.md) he was defeated by GREG in a Hardcore Match for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md). Once the bell rang, the bleeding David fell victim to Kawaleria's attack, which included putting a ball gag on him. He was saved by other babyfaces feuding with Kawaleria, who formed a faction called Sojusz (_The Alliance_). This led to Oliwa becoming a member of the faction and face Kawaleria in an Eight Man Tag Team Elimination Match at [Arena X: Kawaleria vs Sojusz](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md).

#### Reunion and programme with Boski Ostrowski

Within a few years Oliwa developed his character as one of the top babyfaces in KPW. He became known for his leisurely entrances and a penchant for handing out lollipops to (mostly) female fans, and affectionately referred to as the "guy in undies" (_facet w gaciach_) due to his choice of ring gear. He used Rupert Holmes's [Escape (The Piña Colada song)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zROIlspgOjM) as his entrance theme.

After the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament was announced, David quickly allied himself with his old teammate Boski Ostrowski. At [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md), as "Boska Oliwa", they managed to advance to the finals of the tournament, defeating the team of [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and Greg, and the British Bouncer Club, making it to the finals where they lost to Sawicki and Rosetti. This marked the first major crack in their relationship, which deteriorated further when they were set up for a match at [Arena 12](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12.md) with a KPW OldTown Championship #1 Contender spot at stake. Oliwa defeated his tag team partner, which caused Ostrowski to turn on him after the match. 

#### KPW OldTown Champion

At [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md) Oliwa managed to defeat Greg in an "I Quit" Match, thus becoming the second OldTown Champion in history. Later, Ostrowski tried to challenge David for a match, but was booked against [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md). He managed to emerge victorious in that match, and even got into a physical altercation with Oliwa. At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) Ostrowski managed to win the Magnificent Seven Elimination Ladder Match, which allowed him to once more face his former friend Oliwa for the KPW OldTown Championship. [Chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) decided to add one more opponent to the planned match - Greg - which was met with Boski's negative reaction. At [Arena 15](@/e/kpw/2019-11-16-kpw-arena-15.md) the scheduled match took place, but it was Oliwa who emerged victorious. 

From that point on Oliwa made numerous appearances as the champion, managing to secure a solid streak of succesful title defences against multiple wrestlers, such as [Michael Kovac](@/w/michael-kovac.md) and Martin Pain. After the pandemic Oliwa managed to secure more victories and even challenged the reigning KPW Champion Greg for his title at [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md), but he was unable to become a double champion. After the match David lost his OldTown Championship to Rosetti - Greg's follower - who cashed in his contract for said championship. His title reign lasted a record of 1190 days (although over 500 days fell on the COVID-19 pandemic, when no wrestling events took place).

#### Heel turn

After spending the first half of 2023 in midcard, David seemingly started getting more frustrated. This frustration erupted after his defeat in a match against Iestyn Rees at [Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md). From that point on Oliwa stayed in midcard, working against wrestlers such as [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) and [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md). At [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) he defeated Lato in a Qualifier Match for the KPW Championship, but in the final match for the contendership he was defeated by [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) in a Triple Threat Match.

#### Tag Team Champion

At [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md), along with his partner [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) (as [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md)), he won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) by defeating [Bracia Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025)

In April 2025 David made his debut for [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) at their [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), where he faced - and defeated - [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) in a Singles Match.
