## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2009-2012)

Joe Legend made his Polish debut in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in July 2009, working at [DDW's first Open House Show](@/e/ddw/2009-07-20-ddw-open-house.md) in Warsaw.
He took on and defeated DDW's owner and head coach [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) in a Singles Match, the only match of the night.
Legend returned in May 2010 to score a victory in a Ten Man Gauntlet Match for the [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) at [All Or Nothing](@/e/ddw/2010-05-08-ddw-all-or-nothing.md).
This victory made him the first champion in the modern history of Polish professional wrestling.
In 2011 and 2012 he made three more appearances for DDW, defending his championship twice. The last one took place at [DDW #7](@/e/ddw/2012-03-10-ddw-7.md) in March 2012.
In the main event of this show he faced [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), with the match being ruled a No Contest. After that appearance Joe Legend left DDW and vacated his DDW International Championship; his reign lasted 672 days.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2022)

After almost a decade of inactivity on the Polish wrestling scene, Joe E. Legend returned to Poland, working for the newly-created [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), owned by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) who met Legend back in the DDW days.
Legend fought at PTW's first show, [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), in October 2021, where he faced and defeated ex-[KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestler [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md).
Later - aside from acting as in-ring coach at [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) - he also competed at the first [Underground show](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md), where he was defeated by [Remo](@/w/remo.md).
