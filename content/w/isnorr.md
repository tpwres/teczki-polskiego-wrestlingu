## Professional wrestling career

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2016-2018)

Norris started his career in [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md), a backyard federation based in Toruń.
His first match took place in June 2016, where he was one of the contenders in the [Tournament of Dreams](@/e/dfw/2016-06-11-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-1.md), losing in the quarter finals to [Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md).
He was portrayed as a babyface persona, and since his debut, he appeared at most of DFW's shows.
The highlight of his career in DFW came at [Charity Gauntlet](@/e/dfw/2018-03-08-dfw-charity-gauntlet-match.md) in March 2018, where he defeated [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) in a Gauntlet Match for the vacated [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md).
As the champion, he managed to score a successful title defense against [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) at [Crosswords City 2](@/e/dfw/2018-06-09-dfw-crosswords-city-2.md) - the final show ever produced by Dream Factory Wrestling.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

Around the time of DFW's closure, Norris started his training in [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md) - a dojo school connected to [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md).
He made his debut at [Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) in a Rookie Battle Royal alongside other up-and-coming names such as [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Nathan Cross](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Krueger](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Ring Rat](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md).
Later on he returned as a villainous manager and Tag Team partner of Nathan Cross, forming a short-lived alliance between them for the duration of the [Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md) programme.
After the COVID-19 pandemic ended, Isnorr made yet another, final appearance in MZW at [Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) where he took part in a Triple Threat Match against Deti Black and Krueger.

During his MZW tenure Isnorr, along with numerous other wrestlers, started an insider group called ["The Greens"](@/tt/zieloni.md), which later on would become influential across the entire Polish wrestling scene.

### PpW Ewenement (2021-present)

#### Debut and early feuds

Isnorr debuted for [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) in June 2021 while still being a member of MZW. He faced his DFW rival Madman Charlie at [Ledwo Legalne I](2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md). After that he faced [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) at [PpW Inside Job](@/e/ppw/2021-09-11-ppw-inside-job.md). At [PpW Mistrz Jest Tylko Jeden](@/e/ppw/2022-03-12-ppw-mistrz-jest-tylko-jeden.md) he faced [Royal Striker](@/w/royal-striker.md) and his old rival from DFW: [Direk](@/w/direk.md), and at [Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md) another DFW & MZW rival - [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md) - anwsered his Open Challenge. 

#### Feud with Biesiad Strong

In February 2023 at [Back To The OG](@/e/ppw/2023-02-04-ppw-back-to-the-og.md) Isnorr was one of the contenders in a Triple Threat Hardcore Match for [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md). His opponent was again Biesiad Strong, and Belgian wrestler [Steve Kuningas](@/w/steve-kuningas.md). He was however defeated, which led to his match against Kuningas at [Piwa I Igrzysk](@/e/ppw/2023-03-11-ppw-piwa-i-igrzysk.md) in which he was again defeated. Isnorr spent the rest of 2023 fighting mostly in Singles Matches up until he finally got a chance to get his hands on fan favourite Biesiad Strong. At [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) in December 2023 he managed to score a victory over him in a Street Fight Match.

#### Championship pursuit

After his victory over Biesiad the rivalry has not ended. During the said match Biesiad was attacked by [Chris X](@/w/chris-x.md) which allowed Isnorr to win. Later that night both Isnorr and Biesiad got involved in a Christmas Massacre Match between Chris X and Biesiad's friend [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). This led to setting up a match at [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) where Chris X and Isnorr took on Biesiad and Johnny, known as "The Hardcores". Isnorr and Chris were defeated by two babyfaces, which led to Chris X turing on Isnorr. At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) Isnorr took part in Critical 4/20 Ladder Match, which was won by [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md).

At [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) Isnorr confirmed himself as a valid runner-up for the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md), where he inserted himself into the Born To Be Wired Four Way Elimination Match against Johnny Blade, [Alex Arthur](@/w/alex-arthur.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). He was unsucessful in scoring a win, but he earned a opportunity to a 1vs1 rematch at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), where he was again defeated by Blade. This however didn't meant that he would be off out of the title pitcure, as he continued to haunt Johnny vowing to destroy all of the "backyarders" on Polish wrestling scene. Around that time he also joined ["Zmowa"](@/tt/zmowa.md) - a villainous stable led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) as their "Ultraviolent Specialist". At [Hardcore Friday X4](content/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) he emerged victorious from Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match which was held by Johnny Blade. At [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) he alligned himself with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) to defeat Johnny and [Samson](@/w/samson.md) - Gustav's rival. Two victories in a row over Johnny allowed Isnorr to face him in a another ultraviolent variation: Blood God Ritual - Trial by Metal and Glass Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) in October 2024, where he finally defeated Johnny and became PpW Ultraviolent Champion.

#### PpW Ultraviolent Champion and retirement

After his victory over Johnny Blade Isnorr made his first defences on non-canon shows at [Splat!FilmFest](@/e/ppw/2024-10-30-ppw-chcemy-krwi.md) in Palace of Culture and Science and [PpW Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md) in Poznań. At [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz z Krzesłami](@/e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md) he held a Open Challenge which was anwsered by his Zmowa ally [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md). Next one took place at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) where Isnorr faced former Ultraviolent Champion Stanisław Van Dobroniak in a Donky Kong Weaponmaster Match. At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) he again alligned himself with Gustav Gryffin to fight off Pure Gold ([Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)) in a Tornado Tag Team Match. Unfortunately for Isnorr, he was the one to be pinned by victorious Pure Gold, which resulted in Gustav's first defeat as a PpW Champion.

At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) Isnorr entered the 20 Typa, 20 Broni Battle Royale for the PpW Championship opportunity at [Ledwo Legalne V](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md), but he was unable to win it due to suffering an serious injury during a match. At [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) Isnorr came out and cut a promo discussing his future in the business, explaining that despite that he may heal his arm, he was also notified of a serious cardiac condition, which prevents him from further competing in a PpW's ring. He vacated his championship, seemingly retiring from in-ring competition.
