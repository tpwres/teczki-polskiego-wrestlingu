## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2012)

Matt2Hot made a single appearance in [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) back in 2012 in a tag team match teaming up with his (storyline or real-life) brother Matt2Hot Jr. against [Snake](@/w/snake.md) and [Matt Blazer](@/w/blazer.md). 

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2019)

Matt2Hot debuted as a referee during first-ever public event held by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) - [Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/mzw/2014-05-10-mzw-pokaz-adeptow.md). After that he made his return four years later at [MZW Project 2: Four](@/e/mzw/2018-12-08-mzw-project-2-four.md). Due to a referee shortage in MZW, he continued his regular appearances for the next three shows up until [MZW Project 5: Hero](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md) in June 2019. For most of that time he either worked alone or alongside [Referee Tobias](@/w/sedzia-tobias.md). Project 5 marked his last appearance on the Polish wrestling scene, as he seemingly retired from wrestling.

### PpW Ewenement (2015)

In 2015 Matt2Hot made a one-off appearance as an in-ring comptetior during [PpW's](@/o/ppw.md) backyard show [Gala Na Hali](@/e/ppw/2015-05-16-ppw-gala-na-hali.md), where he fought against Electrico.
