## Professional wrestling career

### Pomerania Indy Wrestling Group (2005-2009)

Kamil Aleksander started his career in a backyard group called [Pomerania Indy Wrestling Group](@/o/piwg.md), which he started around 2005, being the only one coach there. Not much is known from those days, but it is confirmed that during his time his ringname was "The Seraphim", and held their single title, the PIWG Pomerania Championship. Besides coaching a group of backyard wrestlers, he also made at least three recorded appearances in said backyard group. Kamil eventually left PIWG in 2009, after he started training with [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2009-2015)

Once Kamil made his transfer to DDW, he quickly debuted in the federation at their [Student Show](@/e/ddw/2009-08-08-ddw-student-show.md) in August 2009, where he defeated [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md). Up until 2010 he wrestled under his real-life name Kamil Manuszewski, before switching to Kamil Aleksander from that point on. He quickly became one of the most prominent Polish members of the roster. He was portrayed as a babyface. At [DDW All Or Nothing](@/e/ddw/2010-05-08-ddw-all-or-nothing.md) Kamil competed for the [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) in a Ten Man Gauntlet Match, ultimately won by [Joe Legend](@/w/joe-legend.md). After that he quickly gained a rematch opportunity, by defeating Chris Botherway in a Lumberjack Match at [DDW #5 Dzień Sądu](@/e/ddw/2011-01-15-ddw-5-dzien-sadu.md). However, his match against Legend at [DDW #7](@/e/ddw/2012-03-10-ddw-7.md) was declared No Contest.

After a short series of defeats in 2013, Kamil got back on track during the tournament for the vacated DDW International Championship at [All Or Nothing II](@/e/ddw/2014-08-17-ddw-all-or-nothing-2.md) in August 2014, where he defeated Klarys, [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), and finally [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md) to become the second DDW International Champion in history. Kamil Aleksander held the title up until DDW's closure after [Baltikon](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md) in July 2015, which marks the end of his reign, lasting about 341 days.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019; 2026-)

After DDW's closure and rebranding into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Kamil joined the federation as a worker and coach in their academy. He retained his high status in the card, being one of the main babyfaces in the federation. He feuded with top heels such as [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), but was unable to defeat him for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) at [KPW Godzina Zero 2016](@/e/kpw/2016-08-13-kpw-godzina-zero-2016.md). Later on he led "Team Aleksander" against members of Kawaler's faction - Kawaleria - in an Eight Man Elimination Match at [KPW Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md).

After that victory Kamil spent most of 2018 and 2019 in championship pursuits, trying to earn #1 Contender spot in multiple matches for the KPW Championship, [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) and the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md), but was unsuccessful in all of these ventures.

Kamil Aleksander fought his last match in KPW at [KPW Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) where he was defeated by Reinbakh. After that he seemingly retired from in-ring activites and focused solely on coaching.

Six years later Kamil Aleksander made a surpise appearance at [KPW Arena 31](@/e/kpw/2026-01-16-kpw-arena-31.md) where he announced his return to the ring. Markus Paskal, KPW's newest debutant at the time, introduced Kamil as his mentor and tag team partner in a match against [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) at [Arena 32](@/e/kpw/2026-03-13-kpw-arena-32.md).

## International wrestling appearances 

Between 2010 and 2014 Kamil made a handful of appearances in federations in the UK (Scottish Wrestling Entertainment and Great Bear Promotions) and in Hunagary (Hungarian Championship Wrestling).
