## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2019-2020)

Referee Matek made his debut at [PpW's](@/o/ppw.md) first-ever open to public event - [2KOŁA To My Nie Zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md). After that he made yet another appearance at [Brawl for the Puppies](@/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md), which was his final one in PpW.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2022)

Matek joined [Prime Time Wresling](@/o/ptw.md) fairly early in its development. He was the sole referee for first two PTW shows - including [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) - before being joined by [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) in January 2022, and [Referee Rafał](@/w/alex-brave.md) in August of the same year. Near the end of the year he bagan to express his dissatisfaction with [Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) way of handling PTW and decided that due to logistics he cannot appear at PTW shows as often. 

Matek was last seen as a referee on December 18th, 2022, when the infamous [Underground 10](@/e/ptw/2023-01-28-ptw-underground-10.md) was set to take place, but was cancelled due to a power outage in the [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md). This was the last time Referee Matek appeared in PTW, as he quietly [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md).
