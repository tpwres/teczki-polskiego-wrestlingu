## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2009-2015)

In 2009 Pawłowski was one of the four people to attend the very first training session of the newly-opened [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) (the other three being [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md) and Antek from [Istota Wrestlingu][yt-iw]).
He didn't wrestle, however, instead focusing on the role of manager and ring announcer.

In DDW he served as both, and adopted a persona of a heelish, self-important manager. He made his one and only appearance as an in-ring competitor at [DDW Show](@/e/ddw/2014-12-13-ddw-12.md) in December 2014, where he faced [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md) under the "Fatman" alias.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

After DDW folded, he and other former DDW talent opened [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), where Pawłowski continued his duties as ring announcer.
This lasted until 2019's [KPW Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md), after which he parted ways with the promotion. In 2024, KPW owner and booker [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) revealed that it was him who fired Pawłowski from the organization, over creative and personal differences.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-present)

#### Creation of PTW

After his departure from KPW, Pawłowski spent the next two years working for Fame MMA, and in the second half of 2021 announced the opening of [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).
This new promotion was founded together with Marcin "Rzeźnik" Rzeźniczek as co-owner, however Rzeźniczek left after [PTW#5](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), leaving Pawłowski the sole owner.

Pawłowski is one of the main faces of the promotion, with his promoter role acknowledged on-screen. He typically hosts the shows, does the ring announcing, and makes authority figure decisions. It's not uncommon for him to openly comment on match outcomes and wrestlers' behaviour, as well as to be involved in storylines. Most notably, between 2022 and early 2024 he feuded with [John "Bad Bones" Klinger](@/w/bad-bones.md) and [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), who were trying to destroy PTW from the inside.

#### After reboot

Despite numerous controversies - especially after a huge PR crisis following the [2024 talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) - his PTW persona had continued as a babyface since the promotion started. Pawłowski turned heel for the first time in his PTW run in December 2024 at [PTW Underground 25](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), laying out [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) with a chair in his [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) match against [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md). After that he justified all of his on- and off-screen actions - past, present or future - attributing it to being done with the "good uncle" persona, and just reverting to being himself.

After his on-screen heel turn, Pawłowski also increased his social media activity, frequently getting into disputes with displeased fans, calling them "piwniczaki" (_basement dwellers_) and shooting at ex-PTW talents, such as various members of ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md), [Samson](@/w/samson.md) and personnel who left to form [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md). He also called out owners of other federations, like [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) from [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) and [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) from [MZW](@/o/mzw.md).
