Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski is the co-founder and owner of [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). Outside of his wrestling career, Pawłowski was also involved with several Polish freak-fight MMA organizations as their announcer, and performed stand-up comedy.

## Professional wrestling career

### 2009: DDW

In 2009 Pawłowski was one of the four people to attend the very first training session of the newly-opened [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) (the other three being [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md) and Antek from [Istota Wrestlingu][yt-iw]).
He didn't wrestle, however, instead focusing on the role of manager and ring announcer.

In DDW he served as both, and adopted a persona of a heelish, self-important manager.

### 2014: Founding of KPW

After DDW folded, he and other former DDW talent opened [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), where Pawłowski continued his duties as ring announcer.
This lasted until 2019's [KPW Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md), after which he parted ways with the promotion.

### 2021-present: Prime Time Wrestling

Pawłowski then spent the next two years working for Fame MMA, and in the second half of 2021 announced the opening of [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).
This new promotion was founded together with Marcin "Rzeźnik" Rzeźniczek as co-owner, however Rzeźniczek left after [PTW#5](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), leaving Pawłowski the sole owner. Pawłowski is one of the main faces of the promotion, with his promoter role acknowledged on-screen. He typically hosts the shows, does the ring announcing, and makes authority figures decisions. It's not uncommon for him to openly comment on match outcomes and wrestlers' behaviors, as well as to be involved in the storylines.

Despite numerous controversies, his PTW persona had continued as a babyface since the promotion started. He turned heel for the first time in his PTW run in December 2024 at [PTW Underground 25](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), laying out [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) with a chair in his [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) match against [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md).
