## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-present)

Zefir made his in-ring debut at [KPW Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md), where he faced [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md).
Despite never speaking he got over with the fans almost immediately, owing to his dynamic, high-risk style, the ability to communicate through body language alone, and his unique entrance, featuring a fire breathing routine.

Zefir usually fights solo, although a few times he formed a tag team with [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md). They even tried to compete for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) against Die Ordnung at [KPW Arena 21](@/e/kpw/2023-02-24-kpw-arena-21.md), but without success.

Until [Godzina Zero 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md) he and [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) were the only two KPW wrestlers who never missed a show since their debuts, but this streak was broken when Zefir sustained an injury that forced him to sit out [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md). During his few years in KPW he managed to achieve a solid midcard position within the company.

At [KPW Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md) Zefir defeated [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md), becoming the new [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md). After his victory he took a microphone and spoke for the very first time, declaring simply "I did it!"
