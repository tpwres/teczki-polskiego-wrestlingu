Zefir is a high-flying masked luchador, working for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).
He made his in-ring debut at [KPW Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md), where he faced [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md).
Despite never speaking he got over with the fans almost immediately, owing to his dynamic, high-risk style, the ability to communicate through body language alone, and his fire breathing routine.

Zefir usually fights solo, although a few times he formed a tag team with [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md).

Until [Godzina Zero 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md) he and [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) were the only two KPW wrestlers who never missed a show since their debuts, but this streak was broken when Zefir sustained an injury that forced him to sit out [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md).
