## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016; 2020; 2023)

Alex Arthur made his debut in Poland working occasionally for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md).
His first match was at [Revolution](@/e/mzw/2016-11-05-mzw-revolution.md), a Two On One Handicap Match against [Mr B.](@/w/mr-b.md) and [Hexia](@/w/hexia.md), which the monster heels won.
In January 2020 he returned to face [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) at [Project 7](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md), where he lost again. In a rematch at [Game ON](@/e/mzw/2023-03-11-mzw-game-on.md) he was also unsuccessful.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

Alex made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md), facing the reigning [PpW European Ultraviolent Champion](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md) [Stanis≈Çaw Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md).
This match has since been considered one of the most brutal and bloody bouts in Polish wrestling history, but despite Arthur's sacrifice he was unable to win the match, officiated by special referee [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), also a contender for the Championship.
At [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) Arthur inserted himself into the Born To Be Wired Four Way Elimination Match for the European Ultraviolent Championship, but once again he was unable to secure a win.

Alex was scheduled to face [Feager](@/w/feager.md) in a Chairs Match at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md) but pulled out of the match due to undisclosed, private reasons. He got another chance to face Feager in a Chairs Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), which resulted in Arthur's another defeat.
