## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation (1999-2003)

Around 1999 Paweł Borkowski came to Andrzej Supron with a plan to create the first pro wrestling federation in the country. The name for this was simply "Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation", or PPWF. However, the results were much more modest than expected: unable to secure international names, the organization had to rely only on home-grown talent. They did manage to secure sponsorship and a deal to buy a professional wrestling ring. Due to poor ticket sales, however, no events were actually held. A second attempt in 2003 secured support from Belgian wrestler and promoter Bernard Vandamme, but once again the event was cancelled, just three weeks before the scheduled date. The main sponsor withdrew, reportedly because market research found out that Polish viewers cared little about wrestling.

### Total Blast Wrestling (2009-2011)

#### Split from Do Or Die Wrestling

In 2008, American wrestler [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) settled in Poland, and finding no pro wrestling organizations, opened his own. He also managed to acquire Borkowski and Supron's support. The newly created [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) had ambitious plans, which included holding an event in Warsaw's Stodoła club. However, ticket prices for this event proved to be too high and the public interest in pro wrestling too low, ultimately leading to the show's cancellation. After that, Supron and Borkowski ended their collaboration with DDW, and set off with their own plan.

#### Successful events

Borkowski and Supron once again contacted Bernard Vandamme, whose wrestling promotion - Eurostars - was holding events in Belgium and France at that time and had a solid roster of experienced workers, if unknown to Polish fans. With Bernard's help they also contacted Fight Club Finland, European Wrestling Association from Austria, and the German Wrestling Federation.

Borkowski and Supron held the [first event](@/e/tbw/2010-02-27-tbw-1.md) of the newly created [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md) in February 2010. From the get-go they put in serious effort and money. The event was to be highly produced, with pyrotechnics, professional lightning and sound. Extreme Sports Channel, which the duo worked for as Polish-language wrestling commentators, was to re-broadcast the event in several episodes. The organisation held [another event](@/e/tbw/2010-06-05-tbw-2.md) in June 2010 and planned more, but due to lack of sponsors they were forced to shut down the whole operation.

Paweł Borkowski served as the commentator and organiser for both events produced, in addition to being TBW's owner.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

Paweł "Boryss" Borkowski made a few special guest apperances for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). He commentated the main event of [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) and provided commentary for other big shows such as [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) and [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md). He even opened the latter show along with [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), as the show's name was a tribute to defunct federation, which "Boryss" used to run.

### Professional wrestling commentator (2007-present)

Paweł "Boryss" Borkowski started his career as a professional wrestling commentator in 2007, when he joined Extreme Sports Channel. He used to cover all of WWE shows from 2007 to 2024, when Extreme Sports's deal with WWE ended due to Netflix taking over the WWE broadcast.
Besides that "Boryss" also worked as a commentator for numerous other TV stations, such as Orange Sport, Eurosport and Telewizja Puls.
