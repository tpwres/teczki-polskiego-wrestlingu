## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation (1999-2003)

Around 1999 Paweł Borkowski came to Andrzej Supron with a plan to create the first pro wrestling federation in the country, to be named simply "Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation", or PPWF. Unable to secure international names, the organization had to rely only on home-grown talent. While they did manage to secure sponsorship and a deal to buy a professional wrestling ring, no events were actually held due to low interest and poor ticket sales. A second attempt in 2003 secured support from Belgian wrestler and promoter Bernard Vandamme, but once again the event was cancelled, just three weeks before the scheduled date.

### Total Blast Wrestling (2009-2011)

_Main article: [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md)_.

#### Split from Do Or Die Wrestling

In 2008, American wrestler [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) settled in Poland, and created the first pro wrestling organization, with Borkowski and Supron's support. The newly created [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) had ambitious plans, but had to scale many of them down due to poor ticket sales. After some initial failures, Supron and Borkowski ended their collaboration with DDW, and set off with their own plan.

#### Successful events

Borkowski and Supron once again contacted Bernard Vandamme, whose wrestling promotion - Eurostars - was holding events in Belgium and France at that time and had a solid roster of experienced workers, although unknown to Polish fans who at the time were mostly exposed to WWE programming. With Bernard's help they also contacted Fight Club Finland, European Wrestling Association from Austria, and the German Wrestling Federation.

Borkowski and Supron held the [first event](@/e/tbw/2010-02-27-tbw-1.md) of the newly created [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md) in February 2010. The event was highly produced, with pyrotechnics, professional lightning and sound. Extreme Sports Channel, which the duo worked for as wrestling commentators, was to re-broadcast the event in several episodes. The organisation held [another event](@/e/tbw/2010-06-05-tbw-2.md) in June 2010 and planned more, but folded soon after due to lack of sponsors.

Paweł Borkowski served as the commentator and organiser for both events produced, in addition to being TBW's owner.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

Borkowski made a few special guest appearances for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). He commentated the main event of [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) and provided commentary for other big shows such as [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) and [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md). He even opened the latter show along with [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), as the show's name was a tribute to the defunct federation, which "Boryss" used to run.

### Professional wrestling commentator (2007-2025)

Paweł Borkowski started his career as a professional wrestling commentator in 2007, when he joined Extreme Sports Channel. He used to cover all of WWE shows from 2007 to 2024, when Extreme Sports's deal with WWE ended due to Netflix taking over the WWE broadcast.
Besides that "Boryss" also worked as a commentator for numerous other TV stations, such as Orange Sport, Eurosport and Telewizja Puls.

On 18.08.2025 a [Facebook post by Marek Pielecki][pielecki] stated that Paweł Borkowski had passed away, an information that was [confirmed][supron] the next day by [Andrzej Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md), as well as [Eurosport][eurosport], [Onet][onet] and other news outlets. No details of the cause of death were given.
