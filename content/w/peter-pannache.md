## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2016-2019)

Peter Pannache made his debut in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in April 2016 at [KPW Arena 2](@/e/kpw/2016-04-30-kpw-arena-2.md). He adopted a babyface persona with his signature "HAŃBA!" (_Dishonour!_) catchphrase, which quickly made him popular with the fans.

In July 2017 he managed to score a contender spot in a match for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), but was defeated by [Greg](@/w/greg.md). In 2018 he joined Sojusz (_The Alliance_), a coalition of babyfaces against heel stable Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_) led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md). They managed to win their Multi-Man Tag Team Match at [Arena 10: Kawaleria vs Sojusz](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md).
Later that year, at [Godzina Zero 2018](@/e/kpw/2018-08-11-kpw-godzina-zero-2018.md), Pannache won the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match for a Championship contract, which he cashed in at [KPW Arena 12: Gwiazda Północy](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12-gwiazda-polnocy.md) to fight the reigning [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md), [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md). He was, however, defeated by the Hungarian wrestler.

Peter's last appearance for KPW took place at [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14-nastepny-poziom.md), where he took part in an Elimination Match for the KPW Championship, but lost. After that Pannache left the federation.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

In 2021 Peter made a return to wrestling when he joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), a new federation founded by his old colleague from KPW, [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). Pannache debuted in Prime Time Wrestling at their first show called [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) in October 2021 in a match against [Joe E. Legend](@/w/joe-legend.md). He was defeated in that bout and he never made another appearance in PTW, subsequently retiring from in-ring competition.
