## Professional wrestling career

### Early years (2013-2017)

#### Backyardowy Wrestling Niezależny & Elbląski Klub Wrestlingu (2013-2014)

Vic Golden started his wrestling career by joining BWN (Backyardowy Wrestling Niezależny) - small backyard federation operated by CMD in Elbląg area - in early 2013. He performed as "Lion" and became BWN Champion at least once during his time in that federation. The BWN owned a hand-made wrestling ring amd hosted shows outdoors mostly throughout 2013 summer season.

Later on BWN has been renamed to EKW (Elbląski Klub Wrestlingowy). Vic Golden along with CMD were two of the preparators of Supron Ring heist from WKSW, which they aqquired in mid-2014 and used since that time in their new indoor venue. Golden's stint in EKW lasted from September to December 2014 during which he fought at least one match against [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) while already preparing himself to train in professional wrestling federation.

#### Do or Die Wrestling & Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015)

Vic transferred to [Do or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) when they moved from Rzeszów to Gdańsk in January 2015. He made his in-ring debut as Prince Victor in March, when he fought in Battle Royal Match at [DDW House Show #1](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md). Then, he made yet another apperance at [DDW House Show #2](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md) - also in Battle Royal. 

In august 2015 DDW went on hiatus and was effectively transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). Vic Golden attended their training sessions but never made official apperance there, leaving federation on bad terms - especially with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md)

#### First return to backyard (2015-2016)

In December 2015 Vic Golden returned to backyard wrestling, making his apperance in few EKW's videos made at their facility. In January 2016 he made his debut in Toruń-based [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) at private exhibition show where he faced - and was defeated by - [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md). 

#### First run in Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016-2017)

Prince Victor's first return to backyard scene was short-lived, as in mid-2016 he joined [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). He debuted at MZW House Show in Opawa and made three more apperances before departing from MZW to make yet another return to backyard due to the rules in force at that time, which made workers limited to only one federation at time, and the so called "backyard" federations were considered taboo among "professional" ones.

#### Second return to backyard (2017)

In September 2017 Prince Victor made his return and therefore his official debut at open DFW event. In total he made three apperances at Dream Factory Wrestling along with winning his third and final match at [DFW Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md). It was a match for #1 Contender for [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md), but due to [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md) departure from DFW and overall hiatus of federation next year this plan was scrapped.

### Hiatus and sporadic apperances (2017-2020)

After his departure from Dream Factory Wrestling Prince Victor was set in a unfortunate situation where every wrestling federation in Poland folded, or he was barred from performing there due to his backyard activity. His relations with Pawłowski and KPW overall ended sourly, so his only option was to return to Maniac Zone Wrestling. He attended their summer camps and training weekends irregurally while he was rebuilding his reputation among promoter. 
During that time he made one-off apperance in Czech backyard federation VcV in 2019, where he faced then-MZW wrestlers [Damien Rothschild](@/w/damien-rothschild.md) and [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md) when he was a replacement for [Apollo Anderson](@/w/apollo-anderson.md) who was involved in car accident.
During that time he also grew closer to [The Greens](@/a/the-greens.md), becoming one of the members of this faction.

### Return to full-time wrestling (2021-2023)

#### Return to MZW (2021)

Victor made his official in-ring return to MZW during COVID-era taped show series called [MZW Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md). After that he made yet another apperance in MZW when he fought against [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) in a No Disqualification Match at [MZW Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) - the first show after the pandemic. Return wouldn't last long - similar to other runs in Vic's career - so after exodus of The Greens he followed his collegues and left Maniac Zone Wrestling for the second time.

#### PTW and Pure Gold (2022-2023)

After [Golden Road Finals](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) Vic left MZW and joined the newly created [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), thus buried the hatchet with [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). He debuted at their third Underground show losing few Singles Matches in a row. Along with new ringname - Vic Golden - he also adopted new gimmick of flamboyant "Golden Boy" obsessed with jewelry and prestige. On the 6th Underground, Vic and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) formed a tag team named Pure Gold. They feuded with PAKA and other teams, and were a strong candidate to win the Tag Team tournament defeating such candidates as FoxJoy - [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md).

Their final match as a team for PTW was during [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), in the tournament final Tables Match for the newly created [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md), which they however lost to PAKA. Later they briefly joined with Legia Łysych ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)) against PAKA.
Golden's last match in PTW took place at [PTW x RYUCON 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) where he was defeated by [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md)

In 2023, Pure Gold made appearances outside Poland, for Austrian Rings of Europe and Danish Nordic Elite Wrestling.
In September 2023, Vic caught an injury at RoE event in Austria and was sidelined from competition. He was quietly removed from PTW's roster page in early 2024.

### PpW Ewenement & Legends Contract (2024)

#### Pure Gold reunion

During [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), Vic's Pure Gold partner Gabriel Queen had a match against another ex-MZW, ex-PTW wrestler [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md). Despite not being billed for the show, Vic intervened in the post-match beatdown, saving his partner. In a [recap post][mb-recap] for the show, PpW confirmed that he has joined the roster. It was announced that he will perform under so-called "legends contract" which _de facto_ means that his apperances would be limited to part-time occasions. 

At [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) he and his tag team partner issued open challenge, which was accepted by their ex short-lived allies Legia Łysych, which was teased in a numerous alteractions in social media. After Legia Łysych joined [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md) Pure Gold became their opponents joining "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie" in a Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) with them emerging victourious from the feud.
