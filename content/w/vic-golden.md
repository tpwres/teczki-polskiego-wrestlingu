## Professional wrestling career

### Early years (2013-2017)

#### Backyardowy Wrestling Niezależny & Elbląski Klub Wrestlingu (2013-2014)

Vic Golden started his wrestling career in the early 2013 by joining BWN (Backyardowy Wrestling Niezależny, _Independent Backyard Wrestling_), a small backyard federation operated by CMD in the Elbląg area.
He performed as "Lion" and became the BWN Champion at least once during his time in that federation.
The BWN owned a hand-made wrestling ring and hosted shows outdoors, mostly throughout the 2013 summer season.

Later, BWN was renamed to EKW (Elbląski Klub Wrestlingowy, _Elbląg Wrestling Club_).
Vic Golden and CMD were two of the perpetrators of the Supron ring heist from [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md), which they acquired in mid-2014, and used since that time in their new, indoor venue.
Golden's stint in EKW lasted from September to December 2014, during which he fought at least one match against [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) while getting ready to train in a professional wrestling federation.

#### Do or Die Wrestling & Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015)

Vic transferred to [Do or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) when they moved from Rzeszów to Gdańsk in January 2015.
He made his in-ring debut as Prince Victor in March, when he fought in a Battle Royal Match at [DDW House Show #1](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md).
Then, he made yet another appearance at [DDW House Show #2](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md) - also in a Battle Royal.

In August 2015 DDW went on hiatus, and was effectively transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).
Vic Golden attended their training sessions but never made an official appearance there, leaving the federation on bad terms - especially with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md)

#### First return to backyard (2015-2016)

In December 2015 Vic Golden returned to backyard wrestling, making his appearance in a few EKW videos made at their facility.
In January 2016 he made his debut in the Toruń-based [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) at a [closed exhibition show](@/e/dfw/2016-01-10-dfw-showcase.md) where he faced - and was defeated by - [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md).

#### First run in Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016-2017)

Prince Victor's first return to backyard scene was short-lived, as in mid-2016 he joined [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). He debuted at MZW House Show in Opawa and made three more appearances before departing from MZW to make yet another return to backyard. This was due to rules in force at that time, which made workers limited to only one federation at time, and the so-called "backyard" federations were considered taboo among "professional" ones.

#### Second return to backyard (2017)

In September 2017 Prince Victor made his return and therefore his official debut at an open DFW event. In total he made three appearances in Dream Factory Wrestling along with winning his third and final match at [DFW Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md). It was a match for #1 Contender for [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md), but due to [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md)'s departure from DFW and overall hiatus of the federation the next year, this plan was scrapped.

### Hiatus and sporadic appearances (2017-2020)

After his departure from Dream Factory Wrestling, Prince Victor found himself in an unfortunate situation where either his past wrestling federations in Poland folded, or he was barred from performing there due to his backyard activity.
His relations with Pawłowski and KPW overall ended sourly, so his only option was to return to Maniac Zone Wrestling.
He attended MZW's summer camps and training weekends irregularly, while he was rebuilding his reputation among promoters.
During that time he made a one-off appearance in the Czech backyard federation VcV in 2019, where he faced then-MZW wrestlers [Damien Rothschild](@/w/damien-rothschild.md) and [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md), when he was a replacement for [Apollo Anderson](@/w/apollo-anderson.md) who was involved in a car accident.
During that time Prince Victor also grew closer to [The Greens](@/tt/zieloni.md), becoming one of the members of this faction.

### Return to full-time wrestling (2021-2023)

#### Return to MZW (2021)

Victor made his official in-ring return to MZW during the COVID-era taped show series called [MZW Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md).
After that he made yet another appearance, facing against [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) in a No Disqualification Match at [MZW Project 8: Golden Road Finals](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) - the first show after the pandemic.
His return there also didn't last long - just like other runs in Vic's career. After the exodus of The Greens he followed his colleagues and left Maniac Zone Wrestling for the second time.

#### PTW and Pure Gold (2022-2023)

After [Golden Road Finals](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) Vic left MZW and joined the newly created [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), thus burying the hatchet with [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).
He debuted at their [third Underground show](@/e/ptw/2022-03-27-ptw-underground-3.md) losing a few Singles Matches in a row.
Along with a new ringname - Vic Golden - he also adopted a new gimmick of a flamboyant "Golden Boy", obsessed with jewelry and prestige.
At the [sixth Underground](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md), Vic and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) formed a tag team called Pure Gold.
They feuded with PAKA and other teams, and were strong candidates to win the Tag Team tournament, defeating such candidates as FoxJoy - [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md). 

During his time in PTW, Vic managed to win in two categories of fan-voted [PTW Awards 2022](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md) - for a Tag Team of the Year as part of Pure Gold, and for a Newcomer of the Year.

Their final match as a team for PTW was during [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), in the tournament final Tables Match for the newly created [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md), which they however lost to PAKA.
Later, they briefly joined forces with Legia Łysych ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)), feuding against PAKA. Their failure to get rid of PAKA and shifting the blame away from them later transitioned into a feud between Pure Gold and Legia themselves, with the pay-off only happening nearly a year later in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md).

Golden's last match in PTW took place at [PTW x RYUCON 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) where he was defeated by [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md).

In 2023, Pure Gold made appearances outside of Poland, for Austrian Rings of Europe and Danish Nordic Elite Wrestling.
In September 2023, Vic was injured at an RoE event in Austria and sidelined from competition. He was quietly removed from PTW's roster page in the early 2024.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Pure Gold reunion & Legends Contract

During [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), Vic's Pure Gold partner Gabriel Queen had a match against another ex-MZW, ex-PTW wrestler [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md).
Despite not being billed for the show, Vic intervened in the post-match beatdown, saving his partner.
In a [recap post][mb-recap] of the show, PpW confirmed that he had joined the roster.
It was announced that he would perform under a so-called "legends contract", which _de facto_ meant that his appearances would be limited to part-time occasions.

At [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) Vic and his tag team partner issued an open challenge. It was accepted by their former allies and opponents, [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md), which was teased in their numerous altercations on social media.
After Legia Łysych joined [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md), Pure Gold became their opponents joining "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie" in an Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), with the team of Vic & Queen emerging victorious from the feud.

#### Pure Gold break-up

At [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz z Krzesłami](@/e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md) in December 2024 Gabriel won a Gauntlet Match, which resulted in [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) - dressed as Santa - gifting him a contract to face the [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md).
With Golden in his corner, Queen failed to capture the championship, due to time-out.

At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) Pure Gold teamed up against Gustav and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). The match resulted in Gustav and Isnorr's defeat, after Vic Golden pinned Isnorr. Nevertheless, it was Gustav's first defeat during his title reign, and Gabriel challenged Gustav for a rematch at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md). The match was set up in a Two Out Of Three Falls stipulation, and during the match, just before Gabriel Queen went for the second pinfall and victory, Vic Golden struck him with a chair, allowing Gustav to retain.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025)

Vic Golden made his [Legacy](@/o/low.md) debut as a heel at [Legacy of Wrestling vol.2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md). What was announced as a singles match between him and [Greg](@/w/greg.md) turned into a tag team match when the unannounced [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) jumped Greg, who was then aided by [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md). The babyface duo won, with Greg pinning Vic.
