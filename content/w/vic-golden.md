Also known as: Prince Victor.

#### PTW and Pure Gold (2022-2023)

After [Golden Road Finals](@/e/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) Vic left MZW and joined the newly created [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), where he debuted at their third Underground show. On the 6th Underground, Vic and Gabriel Queen formed a tag team named Pure Gold. They feuded with PAKA and other teams, and were a strong candidate to win the Tag Team tournament. In 2023, Pure Gold made appearances outside Poland, for Austrian Rings of Europe and Danish Nordic Elite Wrestling.

Their final match as a team for PTW was during [PTW#4 Mystery](@/e/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), in the tournament final for the newly created Tag Team Championship, which they however lost to PAKA. Later they briefly joined with Legia Łysych ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and Marco Hammers) against PAKA.

In September 2023, Vic caught an injury and was sidelined from competition. He was quietly removed from PTW's roster page around December 2023.

#### PpW Ewenement (2024)

During [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), Vic's Pure Gold partner Gabriel Queen had a match against another ex-MZW, ex-PTW wrestler [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md). Despite not being billed for the show, Vic intervened in the post-match beatdown, saving his partner. In a [recap post][mb-recap] for the show, PpW confirmed that he has joined the roster.
