## Professional wrestling career

### Supron Stars (1990-1992)

In early 1990s Andrzej Supron organised a [group](@/o/supron-stars.md) of bodybuilders, sportsmen and actors trained loosely by himself, to perform in Poland and ex-Soviet republics, such as Georgia, Armenia, Lithuania etc. However, not much information or media is available from that time.

### World Wrestling Superstars (1993)

In 1993 Supron contacted a group of American wrestlers touring Europe, called [World Wrestling Superstars](@/o/wws.md), and convinced them to perform a single [show](@/e/wws/1993-12-14-wws-world-wrestling-superstars.md) in Poland. It took place in December 1993 at Torwar arena in Warsaw. This was the only international wrestling event held in Poland before [WWE](@/o/wwe.md) arrived in the mid-2010s.

### Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation (1999-2003)

Around 1999 [Paweł Borkowski](@/w/pawel-borkowski.md) and Andrzej Supron tried to start the first pro wrestling federation in the country, to be named simply ["Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation"](@/o/ppwf.md), or PPWF. Unable to secure international names, the organization had to rely only on home-grown talent. They managed to find sponsors and purchase a professional wrestling ring, but weren't able to actually organize events, due to low interest and poor ticket sales. A second attempt in 2003 secured support from Belgian wrestler and promoter Bernard Vandamme, but once again, their scheduled event had to be cancelled.

### Total Blast Wrestling (2009-2011)

#### Split from Do Or Die Wrestling

In 2008 American wrestler [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) settled in Poland and created the first pro wrestling organization, with Supron and Borkowski's support. The newly-created [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) had ambitious plans, but had to scale many of them down due to poor ticket sales. After some initial failures, Supron and Borkowski ended their collaboration with DDW, and set off with their own plan.

#### Successful events

Supron and Borkowski once again contacted Bernard Vandamme, whose wrestling promotion - Eurostars - was holding events in Belgium and France at that time and had a solid roster of experienced workers, although unknown to Polish fans who at the time were mostly exposed to WWE programming. With Bernard's help they also contacted Fight Club Finland, European Wrestling Association from Austria, and the German Wrestling Federation.

Borkowski and Supron held the [first event](@/e/tbw/2010-02-27-tbw-1.md) of the newly-created [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md) in February 2010. The event was highly produced, with pyrotechnics, professional lightning and sound. Extreme Sports Channel, which the duo worked for as wrestling commentators, was to re-broadcast the event in several episodes. The organisation held [another event](@/e/tbw/2010-06-05-tbw-2.md) in June 2010 and planned more, but folded soon after due to lack of sponsors.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2025)

Supron made a few special guest appearances for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). He commentated the main event of [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) and provided commentary for another big show, [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md).

At [Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md) Supron served as a special guest referee in a match between [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) and [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md). During said match he also got into a physical altercation where he headbutted villainous [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), who attacked Okoński before the match.

### Professional wrestling commentator (1999-2024)

_More info: [Wrestling on Polish TV](@/a/wrestling-on-tv.md)_

Since 1999 Andrzej Supron has been working as a pro wrestling commentator. He started by providing solo commentary for WWF matches on the "Wizja Sport" TV Channel between 1999 and 2001.
Later on he was joined by Paweł Borkowski working for Eurosport, and from 2007 to 2024 for Extreme Sports Channel.
They also worked for Orange Sport, commentating TNA shows between 2012 and 2013.

## Supron's ring

The ring bought and owned by Andrzej Supron became one of the most important artifacts in the history of the Polish wrestling scene. Supron obtained the ring in 2010 and used it to host TBW shows, but later on he rented it to a backyard group called [Wrestlingowy Klub Sportowy Wołów](@/o/wksw.md). In mid-2014 the ring itself was stolen by two wrestlers from the Elbląg area: CMD and the legend currently known as [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md). It was held by the Elbląski Klub Sportowy group for an unknown time before being returned to Supron, who stored it in his wife's back yard in Warsaw.

Over the weekend of March 6th-8th, 2024, it was announced that the ring had been sold to [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). From that point on the ring - officially named "Supron" by PpW's workers and staff members - has been used at PpW mid-, and large-scale shows.
