Wild Boar is a Welsh pro wrestler, best known for his run in NXT UK with tag team partner [Primate](@/w/primate.md), and a long career performing mostly in Wales and south-west England. In Poland, their team won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) in 2019, but was unable to defend it due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With it finally over, Wild Boar could not defend the title due to an injury, and they had to vacate it.
