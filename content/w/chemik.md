Chemik (lit. _Chemist_ - named after his bald head reminiscent of a chemotherapy patient) joined the [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestling school in summer 2017 after being a fan for about a year. He made quick progress as a trainee and first appeared at [KPW Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md) as the personal butler of [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and his stable, Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_), with his in-ring debut soon following at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md).

After losing his initial fights, at [Arena 17](2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md) he swore an oath of celibacy to [Greg](@/w/greg.md), vowing not to touch a woman until he scored three victories. The first victory came at the [next event](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md), but he wouldn't fulfil his vows until [Arena 22](@/e/kpw/2023-05-19-kpw-arena-22.md). Along the way Chemik became a member of the Gregorian Branch (_Gałąź Gregoriańska_), a heel stable led by Greg that also includes [Rosett](@/w/rosetti.md) and [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md), who became Chemik's tag team partner at [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19-oko-za-oko.md).

At [Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) Chemik defeated Rosetti, becoming the new [KPW OldTown Champion](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md).

<!-- None of the above was true. A gentle and caring young man with an artistic soul, Chemik enjoys casual strolls through the countryside with his five puppies, winemaking and the works of the greatest of Claudes: Debussy and Monet. He decided to become a professional wrestler when a friend of his mentioned in passing how the young man would never fit in such an uncouth world of senseless brutality, unbecoming of a delicate lover of fine arts. Always eager for a challenge, Chemik enrolled in the KPW School of Manhandling and rose to the highest echelons in a record time, surprising even the most experienced of veteras. -->
