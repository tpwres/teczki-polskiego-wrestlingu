Chemik (lit. _Chemist_ - named after his bald head, reminiscent of a chemotherapy patient) joined the [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestling school in summer 2017 after being a fan for about a year.
He made quick progress as a trainee and first appeared at [KPW Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md) as the personal butler of [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and his stable, Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_), with his in-ring debut soon following at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md), in a tag team with [Greg](@/w/greg.md).

In his butler persona, he continued to associate with Kawaleria for the next few shows.
At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), after Piękny Kawaler's final match, Greg introduced his new [Pope Pijus I Greg](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md#aftermath) persona.
Chemik also adopted a new gimmick, donning altar boy's robes, and started accompanying Greg, carrying a thurible, imitating Catholic rites as he entered the ringside.

Initially starting with a losing streak, at [Arena 17](2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md) Chemik swore an oath of celibacy to Pope Greg, vowing "not to touch a woman" until he scored three victories.
The first one came at the [next event](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md), but he wouldn't fulfil his vows until [Arena 22](@/e/kpw/2023-05-19-kpw-arena-22.md) more than a year later.
This led to another change in his persona, dropping the altar boy routine completely, and becoming more brash, cocky and outspoken. His ring gear clearly references that period, with a chalice and host displayed on his chest.

At [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19-oko-za-oko.md), [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) joined Greg and Chemik, forming KPW's new major heel stable, called Gałąź Gregoriańska (_The Gregorian Branch_).
Lesak also formed a tag team with Chemik, initially losing to the Fux Brothers at [KPW @ Pyrkon 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-06-18-kpw-pyrkon-2022.md), and later feuding with them for the [Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md).

At [Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) Chemik defeated Rosetti, becoming the new [KPW OldTown Champion](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md).

On 2.11.2024, Chemik [issued an open challenge][yt-chemik-challenge] for his [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) at the [first Legacy of Wrestling show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md).
