## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2018-present)

#### Debut and Kawaleria's butler

Chemik (lit. _Chemist_ - named after his bald head, reminiscent of a chemotherapy patient) joined the [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) wrestling school in summer 2017 after being a fan for about a year.
He made quick progress as a trainee and first appeared at [KPW Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9.md) as the personal butler of [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and his stable, Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_), with his in-ring debut soon following at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md), in a tag team with [Greg](@/w/greg.md).
In his butler persona, he continued to associate with Kawaleria for the next few shows.

#### The Gregorian Branch

At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), after Piękny Kawaler's final match, Greg introduced his new [Pope Pijus I Greg](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md#aftermath) persona.
Chemik also adopted a new gimmick, donning altar boy's robes, and started accompanying Greg, carrying a thurible, imitating Catholic rites as he entered the ringside.

Initially starting with a losing streak, at [Arena 17](2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md) Chemik swore an oath of celibacy to Pope Greg, vowing "not to touch a woman" until he scored three victories.
The first one came at the [next event](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md), but he wouldn't fulfil his vows until [Arena 22](@/e/kpw/2023-05-19-kpw-arena-22.md) more than a year later.
This led to another change in his persona, dropping the altar boy routine completely, and becoming more brash, cocky and outspoken. His ring gear clearly references that period, with a chalice and host displayed on his chest.

At [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19.md), [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) joined Greg and Chemik, forming KPW's new major heel stable, called [Gałąź Gregoriańska](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md) (_The Gregorian Branch_).
Lesak also formed a tag team with Chemik, initially losing to the Fux Brothers at [KPW @ Pyrkon 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-06-18-kpw-pyrkon-2022.md), and later feuding with them for the [Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md).
At [Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) Chemik defeated Rosetti in a Fatal Four Way Match, becoming the new [KPW OldTown Champion](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md).

#### End of The Gregorian Branch

At [Godzina Zero 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md) Greg lost his match against [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md). After the match, he was attacked with a chair to the back by Rosetti, who was angry with Greg for the way he dismissed Rosetti's loss of the KPW Old Town Championship to Chemik at Arena 25. A few moments later, Chemik and Eryk Lesak rushed into the ring and chased Rosetti away, only to unexpectedly turn on Greg themselves, thus ending the Gregorian Branch. With Greg out of the ring, they cut a short promo about how when they joined the branch, Greg was someone estabilished, a true leader - but now, after his losing streak, he was no longer worth following.

#### Singles competition

After this defection from Greg, Chemik focused on defending his OldTown Championship. He defeated Michael Schenkenberg at [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), but after his victory he was confronted by [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md), which led to their Street Fight at [the next show](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md). Chemik managed to emerge victorious from that bout, and defended the title again at the [next show](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md) versus Luca De Leone. However, two months later he lost the Championship to [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

On 2.11.2024, Chemik [issued an open challenge][yt-chemik-challenge] for his [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) at the [first Legacy of Wrestling show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). The challenge was initially anwsered by [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), but the guest host of the show - [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) - added [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) to the mix. Nevertheless, Chemik managed to emerge victorious and keep his title.

At the [second Legacy show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) Chemik intervened during Greg's entrance to his scheduled match against [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md). As he was attacking Greg, [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) unexpectedly entered the fray. Acting Chairman [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) then turned the match into a Tag Team Match of Chemik & Vic vs Greg & Star, which was won by the latter team, as Chemik ran away from the ring during the finish.

## International wrestling appearances 

From 2024 onwards Chemik made a few appearances for Finland-based federation SLAM Wrestling Entertaiment.
