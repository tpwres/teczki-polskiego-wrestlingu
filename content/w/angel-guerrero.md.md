Angel Guerrero was a masked luchador from [PpW](@/o/ppw.md). According to [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) and [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md), he was not any single wreslter, but rather a persona inhabited by multiple people. He was usually portrayed by Blade, but also once by [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) (as Epic Angel Guerrero), and probably by Tymon (at [Crossing Roads 2015](@/e/ppw/2015-08-31-ppw-crossing-roads-2015.md).
