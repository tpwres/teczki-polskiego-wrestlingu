## Professional wrestling career

### Mine City Wrestling (2019)

Shida started his wrestling career in backyard federation [Mine City Wrestling](@/o/mcw.md) around 2019. It is known that he made at least one official appearance there at [MCW's second show](@/e/mcw/2019-06-01-mcw-show-2.md), held in June 2019 in Siemianowice. He faced [David Sirch](@/w/sinister.md) in a Singles Match.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021; 2024-present)

#### Training and injury

After [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) opened, choosing to base itself in Silesia, Shida, along with a number of other MCW wrestlers, joined the professional wrestling federation. He started training there, but suffered an injury during preparations for his debut.

#### Debut and feud with Brave & Caravaggio

After Miyagi returned to training in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md), he made his official debut at [PTW x Ryucon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md) in July 2024, answering [Puncher's](@/w/puncher.md) open challenge but was defeated by the [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md).
Nevertheless, PTW's owner [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) still offered him a contract during [PTW Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md).
Shida's segment was interrupted by [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md), which led to their impromptu match right off the bat. Shida lost this match and continued to feud with both of PTW's main midcard heels, Brave and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md).
He even allied himself with [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md), but they were unable to defeat the villains up until Alex Brave challenged Miyagi for a Career Threatening Match at [Underground 25: Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md). This time, Miyagi was able to secure a win over Brave, save his own career and score his first victory in Prime Time Wrestling.

#### Feud with Serg Sullivan

Having saved his career, Miyagi clashed with Russian wrestler [Serg Sullivan](@/w/serg-sullivan.md). After winning in the Four-Way Match at [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) which Serg was a part of, they got into a heated rivalry. At [Wiosenna Bijatyka](@/e/ptw/2025-03-15-ptw-wiosenna-bijatyka.md) Shida won by DQ after Serg attacked him with a briefcase. At the [next show](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md) Miyagi lost his match due to Sullivan's distraction, which resulted in a brawl lasting throughout the whole show. At [Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md) Shida lost a Last Man Standing Match against Serg, but it didn't end their rivalry. The feud concluded at [Apokalipsa](@/e/ptw/2025-08-30-ptw-apokalipsa.md), where Shida won in a Casket Match.

#### Miyagi Sigma

Starting with [All About The Moné](@/e/ptw/2025-07-27-ptw-all-about-the-mone.md), Miyagi joined forces with [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md) to form a new Tag Team called "Miyagi Sigma". They immedietaly tried to compete against [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md) - a part of [Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) - in a competition for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md).
