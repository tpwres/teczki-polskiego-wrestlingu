## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2012)

Matt2Hot made a single apperance in [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) back in 2012 in a tag team match teaming up with his - storyline or real-life - brother Matt2Hot Jr. against [Snake](@/w/snake.md) and [Matt Blazer](@/w/blazer.md). 

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2019)

After that he made his return four years later at [MZW Project 2: Four](@/e/mzw/2018-12-08-mzw-project-2-four.md).
