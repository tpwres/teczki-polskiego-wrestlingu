## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2022-2024)

Jerry "Rich" Mandecky is PpW's former (kayfabe) owner and authority figure. He was portrayed as an American-born businessman, who earned his first million dollars at the age of 20 due to his extreme talent for investing. As a lifelong wrestling fan, he decided to use his wealth to support the growing hardcore wrestling scene in Poland.

In May 2022 PpW posted a [video][vid-mandec] where Mandecky and his associate coerced the previous owner, [Sun Ju](@/w/rob-scaffold.md), to sign off PpW's ownership to them. Mandecky proudly announced that his "Mandecky Investment Group" had acquired PpW. He explained his business background, prior contributions to PpW and announced a new venue for PpW - [Waldorffa 25](@/v/waldorffa25.md).

At [PpW Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) Mandecky was betrayed and disposed of by his former bodyguard, [Kapitan Bazooka](@/w/kapitan-bazooka.md). Later at the same show it was announced that he is now considered missing. PpW's "Executive Producer" [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) revealed that a contract between him and Mandecky named Z the legal successor of Mandecky, thus giving the "Executive Producer" full authority over PpW.
