## Professional wrestling career 

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2017-2021)

Diana started her career in professional wrestling by training in KPW Academy some time around 2017. She made her early on-screen appearances for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) as an interviewer from [Arena 8](@/e/kpw/2017-11-18-kpw-arena-8.md) onwards. Later on, she - along with another KPW female adept Laura - appeared as [Moloch's](@/w/moloch.md) valets.

Diana made her official in-ring debut at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) where she faced other female Polish wrestlers, [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) and [Alisa](@/w/alisa.md), and Swedish worker Sixt. During her debut she was known simply as "Diana", performing as a obvious underdog rookie. At [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md) she faced Bianca, now working under the ringname "Diana Rega". This, however, marked Diana's last appearance at KPW.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-present)

#### Debut and road to stardom

Diana joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) fairly early in its development. The fderation ran by her ex-KPW colleague [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) allowed her to gain more spotlight thanks to a greater budget, which allowed PTW to put Diana in matches against female wrestlers from abroad. She made her PTW debut at [Underground 2](@/e/ptw/2022-01-23-ptw-underground-2.md) where she won a match against Gaya Glass. From that point on she regularly made appearances against female wrestlers such as Myla Grace, Xia Brookside, Iva Kolasky and Anita Vaughan. She also fought numerous intergender matches against wrestlers such as [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) or Legia Łysych ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)).

Besides her appearances at PTW, Diana also makes works international bookings in Europe, the British Isles and even North America (e.g. SLAM Wrestling Finland, 1CW Pro Wrestling and Westside Xtreme Wrestling).

#### Championship pursuit

After PTW's reboot, which was forced by multiple controversies and [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) caused by the failure of [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), Diana remained with the federation and her position remained stable, since she still had the ability to compete against international female wrestlers. When Pan Pawłowski announced at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) that PTW would create their [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md), it became clear that Diana would be one of the top contenders for this title. At [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) PTW held the first match in a tournament, where Diana defeated Amy Heartbeat.
