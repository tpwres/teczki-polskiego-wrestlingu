## Professional wrestling career 

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2017-2021)

Diana started her career in professional wrestling by training in [KPW Wrestling School](@/o/szkola-kpw.md) some time around 2017. She made her early on-screen appearances for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) as an interviewer from [Arena 8](@/e/kpw/2017-11-18-kpw-arena-8.md) onwards. Later on, she - along with another KPW female rookie Laura - appeared as [Moloch's](@/w/moloch.md) valets.

Diana made her official in-ring debut at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) where she faced other female Polish wrestlers, [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) and [Alisa](@/w/alisa.md), and Swedish worker Sixt. During her debut she was known simply as "Diana", performing as a obvious underdog rookie. At [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md) she faced Bianca, now working under the ringname "Diana Rega". This, however, marked Diana's last appearance at KPW.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-present)

#### Debut and road to stardom

Diana joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) fairly early in its development. The federation ran by her ex-KPW colleague [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) allowed her to gain more spotlight thanks to a greater budget, which allowed PTW to put Diana in matches against female wrestlers from abroad. She made her PTW debut at [Underground 2](@/e/ptw/2022-01-23-ptw-underground-2.md) where she won a match against Gaya Glass. From that point on she regularly made appearances against female wrestlers such as Myla Grace, Xia Brookside, Iva Kolasky and Anita Vaughan. She also fought numerous intergender matches against wrestlers such as [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) or [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)).

#### Championship pursuit

After PTW's reboot, which was forced by multiple controversies and [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) caused by the failure of [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), Diana stayed with the federation and her position remained stable, since she still had the ability to compete against international female wrestlers. When Pan Pawłowski announced at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) that PTW would create their [Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md), it became clear that Diana would be one of the top contenders for this title. At [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) PTW held the first match in a tournament, where Diana defeated Amy Heartbeat. Ulitmately the tournament plan was scrapped, when it was revealed that [Mercedes Mone](@/w/mercedes-mone.md) would made her appearance at [All About Mone](@/e/ptw/2025-07-27-ptw-all-about-the-mone.md). Despite her effort, Diana lost to Mercedes, which resulted in her being berated by villainous [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). That led to her fight against [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md) Puncher at [Apokalipsa](@/e/ptw/2025-08-30-ptw-apokalipsa.md), which she lost.

## International wrestling appearances

Besides her appearances at the Polish wrestling scene Diana also works international bookings in Europe, the British Isles and even North America (e.g. SLAM Wrestling Finland, 1CW Pro Wrestling and Westside Xtreme Wrestling).

In November 2025 [Pro Wrestling Illustrated][pwi-250] ranked Diana #205 on their 2025 PWI Women's 250 list, quoting her successful defenses of the GLAM! title and facing that year's #1 [Mercedes Moné](@/w/mercedes-mone.md).
