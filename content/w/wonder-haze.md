#### Debut and early rivalies

Wonder Haze made his debut in Poland working for [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md) at their show [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), in a pre-show Fatal Five-Way Match.
From that point on he started making rather regular appearances for the promotion throughout 2025.
At [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) he took part in Enigma Scramble Match alongside [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) and [Feager](@/w/feager.md).
The match concluded in a three-way tie between both masked luchadors and Sambor, granting them a pass to the #1 Contender Ladder Match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md), which was won by [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md).
At [Hardcore Friday Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md) Wonder Haze was defeated by Sambor.
After the show he got involved in a conflict between Sentinel, Sambor and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), which resulted in them facing each other in a Lucha Rules Tag Team Match at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md).
The team of Sentinel and Wonder Haze managed to emerge victorious from the rivalry.
