## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2016-2020)

Karol Górski made his debut as a referee back in 2016, where he was a referee for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) since their show [KPW Arena 1](@/e/kpw/2016-02-27-kpw-arena-1.md). He made few appearances, working mostly alongside [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md). At [KPW Arena 6: Selekcja](@/e/kpw/2017-04-08-kpw-arena-6.md) in April 2017 he made his in-ring debut under his referee gimmick in a squash match against villainous [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md). His last appearance for KPW took place at [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md), after which he left the federation during the pandemic break.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

Karol "Iskra" (_Spark_) Górski made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) in 2021 at their first show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md). It was possible thanks to his victory in a public fan vote on PTW's social media, where the fans could pick which of the four contenders will earn their spot in a Battle Royal at said show. Iskra won a contest and made his debut in a Battle Royal, but he was eliminated fairly early in the match. 

After that Iskra continued his career in PTW by making rather irregural appearances at Underground shows in the role of an enhancement talent, losing all of his matches to wrestlers such as [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md). In mid-2022 he aligned himself with another enhancement talent, [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), and formed a tag team called The Bright Lights. However, their losing streak had continued up until The Bright Lights' loss to Pure Gold ([Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)), after which Iskra turned on Marcelito. This led to his only victory at [Underground 13](@/e/ptw/2023-03-26-ptw-underground-13.md). In the meantime he also formed a rivalry with his and Marcelito's friend, [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md), which resulted in their match at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md). Besides the victory over Marcelito, Iskra continued to serve as a heel enhancement talent for babyfaces up until [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md). Afterwards, he quietly [left PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md) and seemingly ended his career, as he never made another wrestling appearance and his wrestling social media have remained inactive since.
