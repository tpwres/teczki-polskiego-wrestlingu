## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2016)

Kripto made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in May 2015, where he fought against [Mr B.](@/w/mr-b.md) at [MZW Pre-War](@/e/mzw/2015-05-24-mzw-pre-war.md).
From the start he portrayed a generic masked wrestler persona. For the better part of his short career he was booked as an enhancement talent, losing his every official match in MZW.
His most important match was also his last one in Maniac Zone Wrestling. As a team with [Red Thunder](@/w/red-thunder.md), he faced [Zbójnicy](@/tt/zbojnicy.md) ([Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md)) in a Tag Team Match for the inaugural [MZW Tag Team Championship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). After the defeat in this match, Kripto seemingly ended his wrestling career.
