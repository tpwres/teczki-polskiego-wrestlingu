## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2016)

Appearing under his real name, Gracjan, he debuted in the ring at [Wrestlefans Party](@/e/mzw/2014-10-25-mzw-wrestlefans-party.md) in 2014.
In January 2015, he portrayed a bandana-wearing masked bandit at [Charity Show](@/e/mzw/2015-01-11-mzw-charity-show-2015.md), billed as Mario Rodriguez.
Later in May 2015, he estabilished the character of Kripto, in a match against [Mr B.](@/w/mr-b.md) at [MZW Pre-War](@/e/mzw/2015-05-24-mzw-pre-war.md).
This new character was a generic masked wrestler. For the better part of his short career he was booked as an enhancement talent, losing his every official match in MZW.

His most important match was also his last one in Maniac Zone Wrestling. As a team with [Red Thunder](@/w/red-thunder.md), he faced [Zbójnicy](@/tt/zbojnicy.md) ([Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md)) in a Tag Team Match for the inaugural [MZW Tag Team Championship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). After the defeat in this match, Kripto seemingly ended his wrestling career.
