## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2009-2015)

Klarys officially started his wrestling career in 2009, when he debuted for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) as one of the first wrestlers trained solely in Poland. In his first match, which took place at [DDW Students Show](@/e/ddw/2009-08-08-ddw-student-show.md) in August, he faced [Kamil Manuszewski](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md). The same night he also teamed with his mentor - [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) - to face Kamil and [Marcin Wilkowski](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) in a Tag Team Match.

At [DDW All Or Nothing](@/e/ddw/2010-05-08-ddw-all-or-nothing.md) he was one of the contestants in a Ten Man Gauntlet Match for [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md), which was eventually won by [Joe Legend](@/w/joe-legend.md). In total, he worked total of fourteen matches in DDW in his career, with the defeat in a Handicap Match against Kamil Aleksander at [DDW's Second House Show](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md) being the last one. Soon after DDW closed itself and the bigger part of the roster went to form a new federation - [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) - in Tri-City Area. Klarys, however, did not joined new federation and retired from in-ring activities.
