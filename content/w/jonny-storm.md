## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

Jonny Storm made his first appearance in Poland in October 2021, working for a newly created federation called [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), at their debut show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md). At that show he faced a fellow British wrestler Jody Fleisch in a bout in which he came out on top. At the next big show, [BlackOut](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md), he was one of the contestants in a Triple Threat Match along with [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), who were involved in a heated rivalry against each other. Jonny made two more appearances at PTW shows in 2022. First, he defeated [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) at [Underground 5](@/e/ptw/2022-05-29-ptw-underground-5.md) in May, and lost to [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) at [Underground 7](@/e/ptw/2022-08-28-ptw-underground-7.md) in August.

Jonny got involved in a short storyline with Axel Fox in July 2023, where he returned as his surprise Tag Team partner in a #1 Contender Match for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) at [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md). They were defeated by [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md) and [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md), which led to their Singles Match at [PTW x Ryucon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) a month later, where the Englishman defeated the Polish Fox.

Jonny Storm returned to Poland at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) in February 2024, where he was one of the contenders in a Gold Rush Rumble Match to determine the inaugural [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md). His last recorded match in Poland took place at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), where he fought against Matt Sydal and Aigle Blanc in a Triple Threat Match.
