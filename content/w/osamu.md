## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2017-2022)

Osamu made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) in 2017, back when the federation was still a backyard wrestling project.

Later, when PpW started transforming into their professional era, he made numerous appearances between 2017 and 2019, including a match against [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) at the first official PpW show open to the public: [2KOŁA To My Nie Zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md).
At [Bijatyka Dla Piesków](@/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md) he won a Triple Threat Match against [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) and Alex Tamatou.

At the same show, Osamu attacked [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), then-reigning [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md), after his match. He did that again shortly before PpW's post-lockdown return at [Ledwo Legalne I](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md), when he attacked Mister Z with a kendo stick after a dojo session. At Ledwo Legalne Osamu managed to defeat Mister Z thanks to an assist from [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md) and [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) to become the new PpW Champion.

At [PpW Inside Job](@/e/ppw/2021-09-11-ppw-inside-job.md), in the opening segment, Osamu was booked to sign a contract for a championship rematch against Mister Z in the main event of that evening. He refused to sign the contract, however, left the Championship in the ring and stated that he is leaving PpW, thus vacating the title.
After the show went off the air, Osamu addressed the crowd confirming he is indeed leaving PpW for a new federation - which turned out to be the newly formed [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). Osamu's run with PTW was short-lived and limited to training with the organization and some staff work. He never made an official appearance at any PTW show.

### Return to PpW, retirement (2022-2024)

After around eight months Osamu made his return at [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md), where he tried to regain the PpW Championship from the current champion [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md), but without success.

At [Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md) Osamu lost to [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md), which marked his last appearance as an in-ring worker. At [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) Osamu managed Tony Sk1n and Madman Charlie in a match against Mister Z and [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md). He was initially set to compete in that match, but was injured before the show.

In 2023 Osamu entered a feud with Ricardo Diesel. He was set to return to the ring at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie](@/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie.md), but this never came to fruition as he presented a doctor's notice (commonly known in Poland as an _L4_). Instead, Osamu introduced the debuting [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) as his replacement in the match against Diesel. For the rest of the year Osamu focused on managing Gryffin, until their falling out at [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) where he was laid out by Gustav and his debuting _personal trainer_ [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md).

Osamu quietly retired from in-ring competition due to lasting injuries, but remained in PpW as a staff member. He also made occasional appearances in [Goblin's](@/w/goblin.md) pre-taped segments. During the build-up to a match against Gryffin for [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), Goblin - unaware of the events of Turbo OG - kidnapped Osamu to spite Gryffin, but this misunderstanding was soon resolved. Later, Osamu supported Goblin in his preparation for a tag match against Legia Łysych, presumably giving him [Axel Fox's](@/w/jakub.md) phone number.

In June 2024, it was publicly revealed by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) via his twitch stream that at the time of vacating the PpW Championship at Inside Job, Osamu had already been a PTW wrestler and the appearance was under Pawłowski's permission.
