## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2017-2022)

Osamu made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) in 2017, back when the federation was still a backyard. He made numerous apperances between 2017 and 2019 when PpW began transformation into their professional era. He faced [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) at the first official PpW show open to public: [2KOŁA To My Nie Zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md). At [Bijatyka Dla Piesków](@/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md) he won the Triple Threat Match against [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) and Alex Tamatou. At the same show Osamu attacked [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) - then reigning [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) - after his fight. He did that trick again shortly before PpW's post-lockdown return at [Ledwo Legalne I](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md), when he attacked Mister Z with a kendo stick after a dojo session. At Ledwo Legalne Osamu managed to defeat Mister Z thanks to an assist from [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md) and [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md). He became the PpW Champion but eventually lost it in a rematch against Mister Z at [PpW Inside Job](@/e/ppw/2021-09-11-ppw-inside-job.md) less than three months later. 

After that defeat Osamu vanished for over eight months before making his return at [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md), when he tried to regain the PpW Championship from the new champion [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md), but without success. At [Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md) he lost to [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md), which marked his last apperance as an in-ring worker. At [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) Osamu managed Tony Sk1n and Madman Charlie in a match against Mister Z and [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md). 

In the late 2022 Osamu subsequently retired from in-ring competition due to suffering an injury, but remained in PpW ranks as a staff member.
