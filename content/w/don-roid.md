In 2023, Roid appeared at the KPW training camp, and [talked to the camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuYpnWOBRDI) praising the way that KPW has developed since he stepped down from wrestling, and how the organization exceeded his expectations. He offered to come back, not in a wrestling but a training role, and support the organization.
