## Professional wrestling career

### Backyard and DDW (2008-2013)

Bułecka got his early experience in a backyard group called Polish Wrestling Underground as well as in Scotland, where he trained under [Kevin Williams](@/w/kevin-williams.md) in 2008. He then joined [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) shortly after its inception, where he initially wrestled as Marcin Wilkowski, before settling on the ring name Jędruś Bułecka (roughly _Andy Breadroll_) and the gimmick of a [Polish Highlander][gorol]. Jędruś also made a few appearances in Scotland, Hungary and Germany - a 2013 show in the latter country is where he was first called "The Polish Hammer". In the late 2013, Bułecka and [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) left DDW and founded a new promotion: [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md).

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2013-2019)

Bułecka began his MZW chapter as Patriota (_The Patriot_), a Polish-themed masked luchador. This was a short-lived gimmick, however, and he quickly returned to his old Highlander persona which he would alternate with Polish Hammer. In 2015 Jędruś started a tag team with [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md), which would become the first [MZW Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). He also served as MZW's coach.

Jędruś made regular appearances at most of MZW shows up until June 2019. Following [Project 5](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md) he seemingly retired from wrestling, however he made a surprising return to the ring at [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), where he was the final contestant in the Battle Royal.

## Other media

Jędruś (or rather Marcin, his real first name) is the subject of [Marzenie Wrestlera](@/a/wrestlers-dream.md), a documentary film about the conflict of his passion for wrestling with his academic pursuits. He is also featured in another documentary titled [Amerykański Sen](@/a/american-dream.md), where he's portrayed as a wrestler and a coach, tutoring several rookies including [Szymon](@/w/szymon-siwiec.md).
