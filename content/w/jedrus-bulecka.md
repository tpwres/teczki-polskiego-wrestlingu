## Professional wrestling career

### Backyard and DDW (2008-2013)

Bułecka got his early experience in a backyard group called Polish Wrestling Underground as well as in Scotland, where he trained under [Kevin Williams](@/w/kevin-williams.md) in 2008. He then joined [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) shortly after its inception, where he initially wrestled as Marcin Wilkowski, before settling on the ring name Jędruś Bułecka (roughly _Andy Breadroll_) and the gimmick of a [Polish Highlander][gorol]. Jędruś also made a few appearances in Scotland, Hungary and Germany - a 2013 show in the latter country is where he was first called "The Polish Hammer". In the late 2013, Bułecka and [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) left DDW and founded a new promotion: [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md).

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2013-2019; 2024-)

Bułecka began his MZW chapter as Patriota (_The Patriot_), a Polish-themed masked luchador. This was a short-lived gimmick, however, and he quickly returned to his old Highlander persona which he would alternate with Polish Hammer. In 2015 Jędruś started a tag team with [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md), which would become the first [MZW Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). He also served as MZW's coach.

Jędruś made regular appearances at most MZW shows until June 2019. Following [Project 5](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md) he retired from wrestling. Years later, he made a surprising return to the ring at [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) in October 2024, however, where he was the final contestant in the Battle Royal.

## International wrestling appearances

From 2011 to 2013 Jędruś made a handful of appearances outside of Poland. Most notably he worked at least one official match in Scottish Wrestling Entertainment in 2011, as well as some appearances on the German independent scene.

## Other media

Jędruś (or rather Marcin, his real first name) is the subject of [Marzenie Wrestlera](@/a/marzenie-wrestlera.md), a documentary film about the conflict of his passion for wrestling with his academic pursuits. He is also featured in another documentary titled [Amerykański Sen](@/a/amerykanski-sen.md), where he's portrayed as a wrestler and a coach, tutoring several rookies including [Szymon](@/w/szymon-siwiec.md).
