## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-present)

Michał Fux debuted in August 2021 at [KPW Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md). He's best known for his tag team work alongside [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md), but he also worked a number of solo matches.

As the Fux Brothers, Michał and Filip won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) by defeating Die Ordnung ([Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) and [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md)) at [KPW Godzina Zero 2023](2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md). In 2023 they also made an appearance at a European Wrestling Association show in Austria.

In October 2024 KPW's chairman [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) announced a new tournament for #1 Contendership for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), called ["Wyścig"](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) (_Race_). Both of the Fux Brothers entered the tournament and won their matches in the quarter finals, with Michał scoring a victory against [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md). In the finals - which were merged into a single Triple Threat Match - Michał and Filip stood against one another and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md). Michał won the match, which would lead him into a match with the reigning champion - [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md).

As of February 2025, Michał is the only active KPW wrestler who's never missed a single show since his debut.
