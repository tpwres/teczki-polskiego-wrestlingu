## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-present)

Michał Fux debuted in August 2021 at [KPW Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md). He's best known for his tag team work alongside [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md), but he also worked a number of solo matches.

As the Fux Brothers, Michał and Filip won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) by defeating Die Ordnung ([Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) and [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md)) at [KPW Godzina Zero 2023](2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md). Michał and Filip held the titles for two years until [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md), where they lost them to [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md) ([David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) & [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md)).

In October 2024 KPW's chairman [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) announced a new tournament for #1 Contendership for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), called ["Wyścig"](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) (_The Race_). Both of the Fux Brothers entered the tournament and won their matches in the quarter finals, with Michał scoring a victory against [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md). In the finals - which were merged into a single Triple Threat Match - Michał and Filip stood against one another and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md). Michał won the match, which would lead him into a match with the reigning champion - [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md).

At [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md) the Fux Brothers faced David Oliwa and [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) in a Tag Team Match for the KPW Tag Team Championship. That time their title defence was unsucessful, which resulted in the Brothers losing their Championships after a 735-days long reign.

Up until August 2025 Michał was the only active KPW wrestler who'd never missed a single show since his debut. This streak, however, was broken in September, when he didn't appear at the [house show in Kadzidło](@/e/kpw/2025-09-06-kpw-kadzidlo.md). 

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025)

Michał debuted at Legacy of Wrestling's [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), where together with Filip he defended their [KPW Tag Team Championships](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) against Legia Łysych.

## International wrestling appearances

In 2023 Michał made his first appearance outside of Poland, when he worked one match for Austrian European Wrestling Assosciation. Two years later, in 2025, Michał returned to EWA and added a handful of matches for Scandinavian promotion SLAM Wrestling Entertainment over the span of the year.
