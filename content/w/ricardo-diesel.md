## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2022-2024)

Ricardo Diesel made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) in March 2022 at [Mistrz Jest Tylko Jeden](@/e/ppw/2022-03-12-ppw-mistrz-jest-tylko-jeden.md) where he faced and lost to, [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md). He quickly became one of the most popular members of the roster due to his charismatic babyface persona of "The Bald God".
At the beggining of his career he feuded with [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md). The feud became heated after Ricardo lost to [Feager](@/w/feager.md) due to Tony's intervention. They fought each other at [Piwa I Igrzysk](@/e/ppw/2023-03-11-ppw-piwa-i-igrzysk.md) where Diesel managed to beat Sk1n in a Loser Leaves PpW Match. After that Diesel started a rivalry with one of PpW's established heels - [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), who managed to defeat Ricardo twice.

After the two rivalries ended, Ricardo only made two more appearances. Firstly, he defeated [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md) and Adam Wong in a Three Way Dance match at [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md). At [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) in February 2024, he made his last appearance, where he faced and lost to [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) in a #1 Contender Match for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md). During this notoriously bloody and brutal match, he took a bump onto a burning table. After that performance he seemingly retired from wrestling without an official announcement.
