## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

Aron Wake started his pro-wrestling training in [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md) during their 2018 Summer Camp held in Wrocław.
His main coaches were [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md).
After a year of training he made his debut in a rookie battle royal at [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), which he won, with [Nathan Cross](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) as runner-up.
Later on, he made his singles debut against [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) at [MZW Project 7: Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md), where he lost.
In 2018/2019 he became one of the founding members of ["The Greens"](@/tt/zieloni.md).

During the COVID-19 pandemic he become one of the regularly-appearing workers in an MZW taped show called MZW Project Basement.
In the [final episode](@/e/mzw/2021-07-21-mzw-project-basement-6.md) he won a 7-man gauntlet match for the Project Basement trophy, which was awarded to him at the first MZW show after the pandemic, [MZW Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md).
Along with the trophy, he earned the opportunity to compete in a tournament for [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md), first winning against Nick Schreier in semi-finals just to be defeated by [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md). This was his final show in his first stint in MZW, as he left company in October 2021.

During that time he also made a one-time appearance at [PpW Supershow 2021](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md) where he defeated [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling and injury (2022-2024)

After leaving MZW, Aron followed most of [The Greens](@/tt/zieloni.md) faction, who decided to make a jump to [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).
He made his debut at [Underground #5](@/e/ptw/2022-05-29-ptw-underground-5.md), defeating [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md).
During his second match at [Underground #6](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md) he suffered a near career-ending collarbone and shoulder injury.
Since that moment he made only one official appearance at [PTW x Ryucon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md), cutting a short promo.
He continued to appear in the crowd during PTW shows, but ultimately [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) shortly after [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md).

### PpW Ewenement (2024-2025)

#### Surprise comeback

During an [interview][wywiad-istota] with Istota Wrestlingu, Aron confirmed that his injury is almost impossible to rehabilitate as the surgery would be life-threatening.

Despite his injury Wake slowly returned to part-time training at [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md), preparing for his in-ring return.
He surprised fans by making his first in-ring appearance in over two years at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), facing [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md) in a chairs match.

He also faced and lost to [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) in a Gauntlet Survivor Challenge at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), as well as in the 20 Typa 20 Broni Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md).

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Championship pursuit and injury

In October 2024 Aron worked at [MZW No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), which marked his return to his original federation after more than three years. He started working as a heel, trying to win the [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md), but was defeated by [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md). At the next show - [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) - Matt initially planned to fight [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) in a Singles Match, but Aron inserted himself into the card, transforming the match into a Triple Threat. Once again, Aron was unable to secure a win over Matt or Shadow. 

At [Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md) in June 2025 Aron suffered another serious injury in his career, breaking his left arm by landing on the apron in a failed ladder dive spot. The injury benched him for the forseeable future.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

During the build-up for [Legacy of Wrestling's](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) it was announced that Aron would participate in a match against an opponent from the first match in his career, [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) (back then working as Nathan Cross). Aron, now working as a babyface, lost to Queen.

At [LoW vol.2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) Aron took part in Fatal Five-Way Match, which was won by a debuting ex-PTW wrestler, [Erik Šlotíř](@/w/erik-slotir.md).
