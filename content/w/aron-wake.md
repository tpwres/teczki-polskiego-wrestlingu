### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

His main coaches were [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md).
After a year of training he made his debut in a rookie battle royal at [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), which he won, with [Nathan Cross](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) as runner-up.

Along with the trophy, he earned the opportunity to compete in a tournament for [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md), first winning against Nick Schreier in semi-finals just to be defeated by [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling and injury (2022-2024)

After leaving MZW, Aron followed most of [The Greens](@/a/zieloni.md) faction, who decided to make a jump to [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

#### Surprise comeback

During an [interview][wywiad-istota] with Istota Wrestlingu, Aron confirmed that his injury is almost impossible to rehabilitate as the surgery would be life-threatening.

Despite his injury Wake slowly returned to part-time training at [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md), preparing for his in-ring return.
He surprised fans by making his first in-ring appearance in over two years at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), facing [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md) in a chairs match.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Championship pursuit

In October 2024 Aron officially worked a match in MZW at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), which marked his return to his first federation after more than three years. He started working as a heel, trying to win the [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md), but was defeated by [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md). At the next show - [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) - Matt initially planned to fight [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) in a Singles Match, but Aron inserted himself into the card, transforming the match into a Triple Threat. Once again, Aron was unable to secure a win over Matt and Shadow.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)
