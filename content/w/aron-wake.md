## Professional wrestling career

### Training and Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

Aron Wake started his pro-wrestling training in [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md) during their 2018 Summer Camp held in Wroc≈Çaw.
His main coaches were [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md).
After a year of training he made his debut in a rookie battle royal at [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), which he won, with [Nathan Cross](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) as runner-up.
Later on, he made his singles debut against [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) at [MZW Project 7: Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md), where he lost.
In 2018/2019 he became one of the funding members of ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md).

During the COVID-19 pandemic he become one of the regularly-appearing workers in an MZW taped show called MZW Project Basement.
In the [final episode](@/e/mzw/2021-07-21-mzw-project-basement-6.md) he won a 7-man gauntlet match for the Project Basement trophy, which was awarded to him at the first MZW show after the pandemic, [MZW Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md).
Along with the trophy, he earned the opportunity to compete in a tournament for [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md), first winning against Nick Schreier in semi-finals just to be defeated by [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md). This was his final show in his first stint in MZW, as he left company in October 2021.

During that time he also made a one-time apperance at [PpW Supershow 2021](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md) where he was defeated by [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling and injury (2022-2024)

After leaving MZW, Aron followed most of [The Greens](@/a/the-greens.md) faction, who decided to make a jump to [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).
He made his debut at [Underground #5](@/e/ptw/2022-05-29-ptw-underground-5.md), defeating [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md).
During his second match at [Underground #6](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md) he suffered a near career-ending collarbone and shoulder injury.
Since that moment he made only one official apperance at [PTW x RyuCon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md), cutting a short promo.
He continued to appear in the crowd during PTW shows, but ultimately [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) shortly after [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md).

### Comeback (2024)

During an [interview][wywiad-istota] with Istota Wrestlingu, Aron confirmed that his injury is almost impossible to rehabilitate as the surgery would be life-threatening.

Despite his injury Wake slowly returned to part-time training at [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) to prepare for his in-ring return.
He surprised fans by making his first in-ring appearance after over two years at [PpW Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), facing [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md) in a chairs match.

Later on he also wrestled for MZW at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), which marked his return to his first federation after more than three years.

It was also announced that he will participate in a match against his first rival in career - [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) - at [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md).
