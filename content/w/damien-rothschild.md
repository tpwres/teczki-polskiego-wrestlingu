## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2015)

Damian Lambert made his wrestling debut in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in March 2015 at their [House Show](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md). In total he made two appearances for DDW - both in Rookie Battle Royal Matches - before DDW folded its operations.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2016)

After DDW's tranformation into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) Damian remained in the federation as a heel, making his debut in a victorious match against [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) at [KPW's show at Gdynia Game Festival](@/e/kpw/2015-12-11-kpw-ggf.md). He remained in the federation for about a year, making a total of seven appearances - mostly in midcard - against wrestlers such as [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md) and [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md). He made his last appearance at [Arena 4](@/e/kpw/2016-11-26-kpw-arena-4.md) where he was defeated by Robert Star.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2017-2019)

Damian won his debut match for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), which was a Ten Man Battle Royal at [Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md). Following this show, Damian Lambert started appearing as Damien Rothschild. Right from a start he marked a strong position in the roster, becoming one of the top villains. At [Project 1](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) he defeated [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) in a Tournament Semi Final Match for [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md), which allowed him to take part in a Tournament Final against [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md), [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md) and the champion Shadow at [Project 2](@/e/mzw/2018-12-08-mzw-project-2-four.md). During the match Shadow pinned Charlie, and Rothschild put an armbar on Kid, who tapped out immediately, before the ref counted the pin. However, referee did not see the tap out, and awarded the win to Shadow. The angry Rothschild hit Shadow with a steel chair which led to their match at [Project 3](@/e/mzw/2019-02-09-mzw-project-3-black-white.md).

Damien managed to defeat Shadow to become the MZW Champion and defend his new title in Shadow's No Disqualification rematch at the [next show](@/e/mzw/2019-03-23-mzw-project-4-open-your-eyes.md). At [Project 5](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md) he defeated another MZW top babyface, Justin Joy. Rotschild's reign came to an end at [Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), where he was defeated by [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) ending Damien's run after 195 days.

Following his defeat, Rotschild retired from professional wrestling.

### Surprise return and Prime Time Wrestling (2025-)

On 26.06.2025 [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) announced Damian Lambert as the second entrant in Gold Rush Rumble 2 at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md). He continued to appear for the promotion over the following months, earning a shot for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md).

## International wrestling appearances

During his British excursion Lambert made appearances in two matches for Coventry Pro Wrestling, and another two for the Birmingham-based Kamikaze Pro. There, Lambert would meet [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), who was also on his UK leave, after losing to [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) at [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md). When Justin returned to MZW in 2017 at [Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md), he brought Damian with him.
