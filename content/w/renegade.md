## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2012-2014)

Renegade made his debut on polish soil in March 2012 at [sixth official show](@/e/ddw/2012-03-09-ddw-6.md) of [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md). He was then managed by Sexy Jessie at took part in two-day supershow hosted by DDW. He made a return to Poland a year later where he faced [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md) for his HCW Championship. After another break he made his last apperance at [DDW All Or Nothing II](@/e/ddw/2014-08-17-ddw-all-or-nothing-2.md) where he took part in a tournament to crown inaugural [DDW International Champion](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md). He managed to advance into the finals, where he was defeated by [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md). 

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015)

After DDW rebranded into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) he made one apperance there at their first official show - [KPW vs the World: Hung(a)ry for Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), where he managed to score victory over [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md). 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Rivalry with Axel Fox and championship pursuits

Thanks to his previous assossiation with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) Renegade made his return to Poland after nearly six years in December 2021 at [PTW Underground 1](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md), when he faced and defeated one of up-and-coming babyfaces of company - [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) - while working as a tweener. In a rematch that took place 9 months later at [Underground 8](@/e/ptw/2022-09-25-ptw-underground-8.md) "Polish Fox" managed to establish himself in PTW's ranks enough to defeat hungarian veteran, thus earning his respect. After that defeat hefaced Axel Fox and his tag team partner - [Jonny Storm](@/w/jonny-storm.md) in a Tag Team Match for #1 Contender to [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). He, along with [Tamas "Nitro" Szabo](@/w/nitro.md) have managed to defeat Fox and Storm. They faced reigning champions - PAKA - at [PTW x RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) but due to outside intervention caused by Legia Łysych their match was ruled as no contest. 

#### PTW Tag Team Champion

Budapest Bastards managed to get another opportunity to fight for PTW Tag Team Championship at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), where they managed to score a victory over PAKA, Sinister Kingdom and MxM Collection to become second Tag Team Champions in history. Their reign managed to last 308 days during which they managed to secure victories over teams such as Axel Fox & Marceltio, Lucha Squad and Gulyas Bros. Their reign came to an end at [PTW Underground 25: Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md) where they got defeated by L'Orda. 

After their loss Renegade along with tag team partner Renegade seemingly bid farewell to [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) claiming that it might be uncertain when - if ever - they will return to PTW.
