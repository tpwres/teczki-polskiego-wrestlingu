## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2012-2014)

Renegade made his debut on Polish soil in March 2012 at the [sixth official show](@/e/ddw/2012-03-09-ddw-6.md) by [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md). He was then managed by Sexy Jessie at took part in a two-day supershow hosted by DDW. He returned to Poland one year later to face [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md), defending his HCW Championship. After another break, he made his last appearance at [All Or Nothing II](@/e/ddw/2014-08-17-ddw-all-or-nothing-2.md) where he participated in a tournament to crown the inaugural [DDW International Champion](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md). He managed to advance into the finals, where he was defeated by [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015)

After DDW rebranded into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Renegade made one appearance at their first official show - [KPW vs the World: Hung(a)ry for Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), where he scored a victory against [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Rivalry with Axel Fox and championship pursuits

Thanks to his previous association with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), Renegade returned to Poland after nearly six years, in December 2021 at [PTW Underground 1](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md), where he faced and defeated an up-and-coming babyface [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), while working as a tweener.
In a rematch nine months later at [Underground 8](@/e/ptw/2022-09-25-ptw-underground-8.md), the "Polish Fox" managed to establish himself in PTW's ranks enough to defeat the Hungarian veteran, earning his respect. After that defeat Renegade faced Axel Fox and his tag team partner [Jonny Storm](@/w/jonny-storm.md) in a Tag Team Match, where the winner would become #1 Contender for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). Teaming with [Tamas "Nitro" Szabo](@/w/nitro.md), Renegade managed to defeat Fox and Storm. They faced the reigning champions - PAKA - at [PTW x RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) but due to an outside intervention by Legia Łysych, their match was ruled as no contest.

#### PTW Tag Team Champion

Budapest Bastards managed to secure another opportunity to fight for the PTW Tag Team Championship at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), where they managed to score a victory against PAKA, Sinister Kingdom and MxM Collection, becoming the second PTW Tag Team Champions in history. Their reign lasted 308 days, and included victories over teams such as Axel Fox & Marcelito, Lucha Squad and Gulyas Bros. Their reign came to an end at [PTW Underground 25: Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), where they were defeated by L'Orda.

After their loss Renegade and his tag team partner Renegade seemingly bid farewell to [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), claiming that it might be uncertain when - if ever - they will return.
