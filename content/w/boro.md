## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016-2021)

Boro started his wrestling career by training at MZW-operated [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md) in Głuchołazy in 2016. He made his debut the next year at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) where he participated in a tag team match and a battle royal. He debuted under his slighty modified real-life name "Bartosz Borowsky". He then changed his ringname and gimmick to "Lady Killer" - a cocky heel womanizer persona. He performed as Lady Killer for the best part of his stint in MZW, mostly during the "Project" era when he appeared at most of the shows. He also become one of the founding members of ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md).

During the COVID pandemic Boro did not appear at the MZW Basement shows and quietly left the federation in early-to-mid 2021.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut and PAKA formation

Boro joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), a new federation owned by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), fairly early in its development. During training and preparations he was paired with [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) as a trio called PAKA (loosely _The PACK_). They were portrayed as laid back babyfaces who know each other since childhood. Boro kept a tiny part of the "Lady Killer" gimmick in his new persona by being the group's ladies' man, but due to the family-friendly nature of PTW, his gimmick was significantly toned down.

For the first couple of shows PAKA focused on establishing themselves as babyfaces and Pawłowski's favourites against heels such as [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Remo](@/w/remo.md).

#### Injury and feud with Pure Gold

Later on Boro was scheduled to fight against [John "Bad Bones" Klinger](@/w/bad-bones.md), who was feuding with Pawłowski by taking out his allies such as PAKA along the way. During that match Boro suffered a knee injury which was his weak point back in the MZW days of his career. For the next couple of shows Boro was sidelined as the manager of his PAKA teammates, while they started a feud with Pure Gold - the team of [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - which would later evolve into a Tag Team Tournament for [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). 
Boro made his recovery shortly before [Underground #12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md), where he faced Syriusz Dziedzic. He made it just in time to help PAKA in their feud with Pure Gold and the newly-founded Legia Łysych - [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) with [Karyna](@/w/karyna.md). 
At [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) Boro lost to Olgierd, but in the main event of the show he made a save to help his tag team partners win the PTW Tag Team Championship in a tables match against Pure Gold.

#### PTW Tag Team Champion, second injury and departure

Despite the fact that Boro did not win the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) and didn't defend it in a match either, he was still considered a champion due to the ["Freebird Rule"][freebird-rule]. Later on he continued to feud with Legia Łysych and Gabriel Queen, as Vic Golden suffered an injury around that time. 

At [PTW Underground #17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md) he faced [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) who at that time was feuding with Pawłowski. During that match Boro suffered a keyfabe knee injury caused by Longman, and he was oficially sent on rehabilitation to France for an undisclosed length of time.

Boro had not officialy [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) until June 2024, when he posted his "Last Dance Story" where he clearly supported wrestlers leaving PTW, such as his teammates from PAKA and the members of his ["Green Gang"](@/a/the-greens.md).
