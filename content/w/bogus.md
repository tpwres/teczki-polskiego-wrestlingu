## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Early appearances

Boguś made a handful of in-ring appearances prior to his official debut as one of the rookies facing [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) in a Three-On-One Handicap Match at [All About The Moné](@/e/ptw/2025-07-27-ptw-all-about-the-mone.md) show. He also served as a referee and timekeeper in a minor storyline where [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) would tease him with promises of a chance to debut in the ring, but always denied it at the last moment. That came to an end during the main event of [Świąt Nie Będzie](@/e/ptw/2025-12-13-ptw-swiat-nie-bedzie.md), where desperate Pawłowski begged Boguś to help Puncher stop [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md). Boguś, however, turned on the leader of [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) and hit a Spear on Puncher to help Spartan secure a victory.

#### Begginings of wrestler career

With Pawłowski's regime ended, Boguś finally gained an opportunity to make his official in-ring debut. At [Odrodzenie](@/e/ptw/2026-01-31-ptw-odrodzenie.md) he took part in a Four-Way Match against [Blaze](@/w/blaze.md), Fashion Gabriel and the victorious [Damian Lambert](@/w/damian-lambert.md).
