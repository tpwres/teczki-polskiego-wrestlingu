## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2017-present)

Fynn Freyhart made his debut in Poland working for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), where he was [Greg's](@/w/greg.md) rival for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md). After the match, he surprised the audience by switching to Polish mid-promo.

From that point on he started making semi-regular appearances in KPW, once or twice a year, mostly as a midcard talent. He unsuccessfully fought for #1 Contendership spots for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) with [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), as well as for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) against [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) at [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19.md).
At [Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) he lost to [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md), in a match for a #1 Contender spot for the KPW OldTown Championship.

Fynn's character is a bandana and leather-wearing rebel rockman babyface persona, a throwback to the 1980s, who often throws the "horns" handsign.
