## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2011-present)

#### Backyard era

Johnny Blade was one of the founding members of [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) back in 2010/2011 along with his fellow clasmates. Since creation of this backyard federation Johnny was one of the wrestlers, who made numerous apperances at early PpW shows. Similar to his fellow wrestlers, he worked under numerous gimmicks and aliases, often wearing mask. 

In his early days his main persona was a masked luchador called Ultimo Combo. It has been used from the earliest PpW days up until 2016. For a shorter periods of time he also performed under more comedic gimmick of "the worst high-flyer in PpW" Angel Guerrero, under his unmasked authority persona Vins Michael $hot, and "Human" - a short living horror gimmick of a mutant. 
From 2016 to 2019 he also worked under his more tag-team oriented gimmick of [Automatico's](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) cousin: Ultimo Combo.
Johnny Blade's main gimmick debuted in late 2014 in a match against Jim Hardy. Over the years the gimmick of reanimated corpse buried on Wola Cementary became the main persona of Johnny, which he uses to this day.

During backyard years of PpW Johnny - under his numerous characters - managed to win numerous "backyard era" championships, which are currently unrecognized by PpW after its transformation into professional federation in 2020. 

#### Going pro

With PpW transformation into professional federation Johnny Blade became one of the main members of the roster. His main specialisation were the ultraviolent matches with his No Rope Barbed Wire Death Match against Viking at [PpW Bijatyka Dla Piesków](content/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md) being the first official ultraviolent match in PpW professional history. At [PpW Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md) Johnny faced Viking once again in a Chaos Gods Deathmatch for both VcV Ultraviolent Championship and newly created [PpW Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-ultraviolent-championship.md). Polish wrestler emerged victorious from that bout and managed to become first polish Ultraviolent Champion, with his reign as PpW UV Champion lasting 112 days before he lost it to [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) in a Three Way Match at [PpW Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md) in September 2022. He lost his VcV Championship to Viking later the same night.

#### Feud with Mandecky and Mister Z

When [Jerry "Rich" Mandecky](@/w/jerry-mandecky.md) took over PpW in May 2022 after buying it from kayfabe owner Sun Ju, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) - a long time friend of Johnny Blade - formed a partnership with the new owner. Johnny himself almost immadately got into heated conflict with Mandecky who despited Johnny for being rebellious against authority. The opportunistic Mister Z gladly accepted any offer from Mandecky to secure his high position on the card and matches with top-level wrestlers Mandecky could bring in to PpW. At [Ledwo Legalne III](@/e/ppw/2023-06-17-ppw-ledwo-legalne-3.md) in June 2023 Mister Z reluctantly agreed to Jerry's offer to face his old friend and fan-favourite Johnny Blade in a Singapore Cane Match. After a brutal bout, Mister Z ultimately turned full-on heel after Mandecky's enforcer, [Kapitan Bazooka](@/w/kapitan-bazooka.md), handcuffed the beaten-up Blade to the ropes to punish him for his disobedient behaviour against Mandecky. 

#### Championship pursuit

After Mister Z betrayed Johnny, he grew closer to his other best friend and fan-favourite [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), ocassionally teaming up with him for the rest of 2023, which led to his feud with another ultraviolent specialists [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) and [Chris X](@/w/chris-x.md). This resulted in a Tornado Tag Team Match at [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) in February 2024. The match was won by Blade & Biesiad. At the next show - [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) Johnny made himself special guest referee in a Dobroniak vs [Alex Arthur](@/w/alex-arthur.md) match and forced Mister Z to lift his ban on competing for UV Championship. Mister Z agreed and that led Johnny to be considered next in line for his long-lost PpW Ultraviolent Championship. Match took place at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md). It was a Born to be Wired Four Way Elimination Match with Alex Arthur and Isnorr added to the mix, however it was Blade who managed to score a ultimate victory and regain his long lost championship.

#### Feud with Isnorr

At [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md) Johnny set up his first title defence against Ultraviolent specialist of [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md): Isnorr, who was feuding with Blade in the past, citing his hatred towards "Backyarders" as the main reason to take Blade down. Johnny was able to score a victory over Isnorr. At [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) Johnny hosted an Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match in which Isnorr reappeared and defeated the host of match. Member of Zmowa confirmed his ambitions for a rematch against yet another vicotry over Blade and his partner [Samson](@/w/samson.md) in a match against him and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md). Official rematch took part at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), and this time Johnny Blade was unable to sucessfully defend his championship against Isnorr.

#### Feud with Mister Z

After Zmowa lost to Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie led by Biesiad at Co Za Noc Mister Z focused himself on taking revange on Biesiad Strong and Johnny Blade - his former friends. He tried to suspend them from federation during [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), but thanks to the tickets they managed to buy they were able to assist [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) in a confrontation against Z and Legia Łysych. After Johnny took on [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) in a Vodka Match at [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) Mister Z managed to capture him, and set Johnny as a lure for Biesiad. This led Mister Z vs Johnny Blade III which took place at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md). In a brutal match Blade was defeated and beaten up to provoke Biesiad, but despite his injuries Blade made yet another apperance that night, when he took part in 20 Typa 20 Broni Match.

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2017)

In September 2017 Johnny, under his masked alias "Black Orion" made one-off [DFW](@/o/dfw.md) apperance, when took part in a [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md) #1 Contender Battle Royale at [DFW Anniversary](content/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md).

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

In October 2024 Johnny made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), when he fought fellow PpW wrestler [Feager](@/w/feager.md) in a No-DQ Match at [MZW No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md).
