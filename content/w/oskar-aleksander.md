  ## Professional wrestling career

  ### 2024 Training & PpW Ewenement

  Oskar Aleksander started his wrestling training in Ewenement Dojo - training facility operated mostly by PpW affiliated wrestlers with [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) as head coach. In a span of few months he became ready for in-ring debut. He debuted as Adept Oskar (_Rookie Oskar_) in a "Young Lion" gimmick highly influenced by his namesake - german wrestler Oskar Leube. In a similar fashion to japaneese young lions he wore black trunks and boots and used limited, but powerful moveset.

  Oskar made his debut as one of the contenders in Johnny Blade's Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match at [PpW Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md). He became the first wrestler trained solely in Ewenement Dojo, who made his in-ring debut.

Since then he would be billed as "Oskar Aleksander". At the same show in a backstage interview he become affiliate with unnamed female "Talent Agent" who started to be his manager.
Besides his regular apperances as Oskar Aleksander, he also performed as "Oskar Strong" - [Biesiad Strong's](@/w/biesiad.md) parody - at PpW's non-canon shows at [SplatFilmFest](@/e/ppw/2024-10-30-ppw-chcemy-krwi.md)
