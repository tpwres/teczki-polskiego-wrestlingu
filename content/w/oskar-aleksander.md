## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Training and debut as Rookie Oskar

Oskar Aleksander started his wrestling training in [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) - a training facility operated mostly by PpW-affiliated wrestlers, with [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) as the head coach.
In the span of a few months he became ready for his in-ring debut.
He debuted as Adept Oskar (_Rookie Oskar_) in a "Young Lion" gimmick highly influenced by his namesake - the German wrestler [Oskar Leube][oskar-leube]. In a similar fashion to Japanese Young Lions, he wore plain black trunks and boots, and used a limited but powerful moveset.

Oskar made his debut as one of the contenders in Johnny Blade's Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match at [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md). He became the first wrestler to make his in-ring debut after being trained solely in Ewenement Dojo.

#### Becoming Oskar Aleksander

After his victory over [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), in a post-match promo he declared that he earned the right to decide what his ringname would be. He also alligned himself with [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md)
Since then he would be billed as "Oskar Aleksander". At the same show, in a backstage interview, he became affiliated with an unnamed female "[Talent Agent](@/w/agentka-agatka.md)", who became his manager.
Besides his regular appearances as Oskar Aleksander he also performed as "Oskar Strong" - [Biesiad Strong's](@/w/biesiad.md) parody - at the non-canon [SplatFilmFest](@/e/ppw/2024-10-30-ppw-chcemy-krwi.md) show.

In January 2025 Oskar Aleksander faced a Polish scene legend - [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - in probably the biggest match in his career at [PpW Gruba Przesada](@c/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md). During 20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) he suffered an injury after recieving a Stallion Cutter from [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) onto a championship belt laying in the ring, which caused him to bleed severly. Despite that, he quickly recovered and managed to both support Agentka Agatka in her first match against Madison Marley. 

#### Joining Vic Golden

At [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) Oskar took part in a Ladder Match for #1 Contender spot for [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), but he was unsucessful in winning it. Later the same night he surprisingly intervened in a match between [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and Vic Golden, helping the legend of Polish wrestling to secure a victory over Queen. In a post-match interview he confirmed, that himself & Agentka Agatka will join Golden, forming an alliance.
