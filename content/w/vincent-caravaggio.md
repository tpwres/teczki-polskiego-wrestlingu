## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-present)

#### Debut and first feuds

Vincent Caravaggio made his debut in December 2023 at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md). From the start he rocked his villainous persona, describing himself as "Aristocrat From Wawel". Main part of his gimmick, besides aristocratic apperance, were long promos, in which he often insulted both his opponents and the crowd, often calling them "wie≈õniaki" (peasants).

Since [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md) he got involved in a storyline, where he alligned himself with other heel - [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) against new generation of PTW's babyfaces - [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md).
