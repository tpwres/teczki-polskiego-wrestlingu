## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-present)

Caravaggio made his pre-debut cameo appearance in an in-ring segment at [Underground 15](@/e/ptw/2023-05-28-ptw-underground-15.md). In the segment where changes to [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) were announced, Vincent - introduced by his first name Kornel - made a short speech about his experience as a PTW trainee.

#### Debut and first feuds

Vincent Caravaggio made his debut in December 2023 at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md). From the start he rocked his villainous persona, describing himself as "the Aristocrat from [Wawel][wiki-wawel]". The main part of his gimmick, besides his aristocratic appearance, were long promos, in which he often insulted both his opponents and the crowd, often calling them peasants (_wieśniaki_), and made references to upper-class lifestyle and wealth.

Since [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md) he's been involved in a storyline where he aligned himself with another heel, [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md), against the new generation of PTW's babyfaces - [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md).

#### Championship pursuit

After [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), PTW's founder and co-owner, turned heel by attacking [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) during his [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) match against [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md), he quickly received approval from both Vincent and Alex Brave on social media. This led to Vincent facing the other chairman - [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) - in a Singles Match at [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md).
Later on, Caravaggio took part in a Championship Tournament for the inaugural [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), in which he advanced to the finals. These took place at [Wiosenna Bijatyka](@/e/ptw/2025-03-15-ptw-wiosenna-bijatyka.md), where Max Speed emerged victorious from a Ladder Match. At [Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md) Vincent opened the show to announce that he is leaving Prime Time Wrestling. However, this was later revealed as a sort of smokescreen employed by Vincent at the end of the show, in order to attack Łukasz Okoński along with Alex Brave.
