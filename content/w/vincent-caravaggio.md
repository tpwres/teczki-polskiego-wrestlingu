## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-present)

#### Debut and first feuds

Vincent Caravaggio made his debut in December 2023 at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md). From the start he rocked his villainous persona, describing himself as "the Aristocrat from [Wawel][wiki-wawel]". The main part of his gimmick, besides his aristocratic appearance, were long promos, in which he often insulted both his opponents and the crowd, often calling them peasants (_wie≈õniaki_), and made references to upper-class lifestyle and wealth.

Since [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md) he's been involved in a storyline where he aligned himself with another heel, [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md), against the new generation of PTW's babyfaces - [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md).
