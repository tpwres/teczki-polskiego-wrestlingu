## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Krzysztof Zasada debuted as a manager in August 2014 in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) at [Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/ddw/2014-08-16-ddw-pokaz-adeptow.md). He worked as a manager named Bogdan, for masked enhancement talent [El Homo](@/w/ostrowski.md). Later on, he was repackaged as Krzysztof Zasada, manager of the villainous [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

#### Managerial roles

After DDW closed down and transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Krzysztof Zasada joined the new federation staying with Gracjan Korpo as his manager. He was often abused by his "client", which earned him a lot of support from the fans. At [KPW Arena 7](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7.md) he finally turned on his client which led to their match at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md) in which babyface Zasada was defeated by Korpo. He made yet another in-ring appearance at [KPW Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md) where he was a part of the babyface team in the Kawaleria vs Sojusz Eight Man Tag Team Elimination Match. He was the first one to be eliminated.

#### Candidate for KPW Chairman position and backstage roles

In late 2018 it was announced that KPW's Chairman position had been vacated, and an election to select a new chairman would be held. This prompted Zasada, along with [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md), to stand for the position. However, a day before the elections, at [KPW Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md), Zasada withdrew from the running and supported Malinowski, granting Krystian a victory in the elections.

After that Krzysztof quietly retired from on-screen activities, focusing solely on his production role in KPW, remaining behind the scene.
