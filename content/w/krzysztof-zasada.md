## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Krzysztof Zasada made his professional wrestling debut as a manager in August 2014 in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) at [Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/ddw/2014-08-16-ddw-pokaz-adeptow.md). He worked as a manager named Bogdan, for masked [El Homo](@/w/ostrowski.md) enhancement talent. Later on, he was repackaged as Krzysztof Zasada, manager of villainous [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

#### Managerial roles

After DDW closed up and transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) Krzysztof Zasada also joined new federation, staying with Gracjan Korpo as his manager, often being abused by his "client", which caused to recieve a lot of support to zasada from the fans. At [KPW Arena 7](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7-wysoka-stawka.md) he finally turned on his client which led to their match at [KPW Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md) in which babyface Zasada was defeated by Korpo. He made yet another in-ring apperance at [KPW Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md) where he was a part of babyface team in a Kawaleria vs Sojusz Eight Man Tag Team Elimination Match in which he was eliminated first.

#### Candidate for KPW Chairman position and backstage roles

In late 2018 it was announced that KPW's Chairman position has been vacated, and the new chairman will be elected. This prompted Zasada, along with [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), and [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) to apply for such position. However, a day before election at [KPW Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md) he withdrew from competition and supported Malinowski, which granted Krystian a win in a election.

After that Krzysztof queitly retired from on-screen activities, focusing solely on production role in KPW.
