## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2017)

#### Posse In Effect

The Grannatic made his appearances on the Polish wrestling scene mostly as a tag team partner for another German wrestler, [Rick Baxxter](@/w/rick-baxxter.md). The duo adopted the name "Posse In Effect" and for the most part made their appearances as classic foreign heel personas. As Next Step Tag Team Champions, they often put their title on the line against babyface tag teams. The Grannatic and his tag team partner also often teamed up with other heels in multi-man matches.

The Grannatic debuted for MZW at [MZW in Smolec](@/e/mzw/2014-06-21-mzw-untitled.md), back in the earliest years of the promotion. He made rather regular appearances up until February 2017, when he performed at [Beatdown II](@/e/mzw/2017-02-18-mzw-beatdown-2.md).

The Grannatic was able to perform for MZW mostly due to friendly relations between MZW and Dresden-based German federations such as Next Step Wrestling. Besides his ventures in Poland, he is mostly known for his appearances in Next Step Wrestling and other German organizations. In 2017 he retired from in-ring competition and instead started working in backstage roles on the Dresden-based scene.
