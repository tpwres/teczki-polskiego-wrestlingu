## Professional wrestling career 

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2019-2021)

Sambor started his pro wrestling career in [Maniac Zone Wrestling's](@/o/mzw.md) school, [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md). Despite his preparations and training he never got a chance to debut there.

Sambor joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) soon after leaving MZW. He continued his training until December 2023, when he finally managed to score a debut against [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md). He was managed by Rusałka and portrayed a babyface slavic warrior.

Plans were cut short, however, as both Sambor and Rusałka decided to [leave the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) after the failure of Total Blast From The Past.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

After an absence of five months, Sambor made his return to MZW, where he faced [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), resulting in a defeat by submission.

At PpW he adopted a more heelish persona, and appeared without his manager - Rusałka.
