## Professional wrestling career 

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2019-2021)

Sambor started his pro wrestling career in [Maniac Zone Wrestling's](@/o/mzw.md) school, [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md). Despite his preparations and training he never got a chance to debut there. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and very limited training and booking schedule of MZW, Sambor decided to leave the federation and the dojo.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

Sambor joined [Prime Time Wresling](@/o/ptw.md) not a long time after leaving MZW. He continued his training up until December 2023, when he finally managed to score a debut against [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md). He was managed by Rusałka and was portrayed as a babyface Slavic warrior. He took part in a few other PTW shows, including a spot in [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) Rumble for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), and at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), where he interrupted [Vincent Caravaggio's](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) promo, seemingly setting up a potential feud.

Plans were cut short, however, as both Sambor and Rusałka decided to [leave the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) after the failure of Total Blast From The Past.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

After five months of hiatus Sambor made his return to MZW, where he faced [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) at [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), but got defeated by submission.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-)

Sambor made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) where he - alongside [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) - got defeated by [Oskar Aleksander](@/w/oskar-aleksander.md). At PpW he adopted more of a  heel persona, and appeared without his manager, Rusałka.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

Sambor appeared at [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) where he - along with [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) - answered [Chemik's](@/w/chemik.md) Open Challenge for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md).
