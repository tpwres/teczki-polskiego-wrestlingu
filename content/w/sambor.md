## Professional wrestling career 

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2019-2021)

Sambor started his pro wrestling career in [Maniac Zone Wrestling's](@/o/mzw.md) school, [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md). Despite his preparations and training he never got a chance to debut there. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and very limited training and booking schedule of MZW, Sambor decided to leave the federation and the dojo.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

Sambor joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) soon after leaving MZW. He continued his training until December 2023, when he finally managed to score a debut against [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md). He was managed by Rusałka and portrayed a babyface slavic warrior. He was was featured in several PTW shows, including a spot in the [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) Rumble for [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), and at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), where he interrupted [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) promo, seemingly setting up a potential feud.

Plans were cut short, however, as both Sambor and Rusałka decided to [leave the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) after the failure of Total Blast From The Past.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

After an absence of five months, Sambor made his return to MZW, where he faced [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), resulting in a defeat by submission.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

Sambor debuted in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) where, along with [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) - he lost to [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md). At PpW he adopted a more heelish persona, and appeared without his manager - Rusałka.

#### Rivalry with Feager

At [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) Sambor took part in the Enigma Scramble Match against [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md), [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) and [Feager](@/w/feager.md), for the inclusion in a match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md). The match resulted in a three-way tie between him and his opponents, with all of them besides Feager scoring a single point. At Ledwo Legalne 5 Sambor took part in a #1 Contender Ladder Match for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md). During the match he was attacked by Feager, preventing him from winning the match. This however didn't lead to any matches, as Feager vanished from PpW programming soon after.

#### Rivalry with luchadors and injury

At [Hardcore Friday Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md) Sambor took on Hungarian luchador Wonder Haze in a Singles Match. He managed to win that bout, but after the show it was revealed that their rivalry was not yet finished. He alligned himself with Marcelito to face Wonder Haze and [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) in a Lucha Rules Match at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md). During said match Sambor suffered a serious knee injury, which sidelined him from competing until January 2026, when he returned at [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście \[Hardcore Edition\]](@/e/ppw/2026-01-16-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie-hardcore-edition.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

Sambor appeared at [Legacy of Wrestling's](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), accepting [Chemik's](@/w/chemik.md) Open Challenge for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), in a match that also included [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md). At both [second](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) and [third](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) Legacy shows he was a part of multi-men matches, but he failed to win either of them.

## International wrestling appearances 

From 2024 onwards Sambor started making appearances at the European independent scene. He made his international debut in Wrestling World Austria, and later on he started appearing in Hungary - most notably for Passion Pro and XWP Pankracio, where he faced [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) in a hardcore match for the XPW Hardcore Championship in June 2025.
