## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut and PAKA formation

Taras joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), a new federation owned by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), early in its development. During training and preparations he was paired with [Boro](@/w/boro.md) and [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) as a trio called PAKA (loosely _The PACK_). They were portrayed as laid back babyfaces who know each other since childhood. Taras was portrayed as good-hearted lad and - de facto - leader of PAKA.

Taras made his in-ring debut in a opener of PTW's first show ever - [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) - where he faced and defeated ex-wwe star Axel Tischer. During the buildup of a match he was hailed as first-ever alumni trained only in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md).

For the first couple of shows PAKA focused on establishing themselves as babyfaces and Pawłowski's favourites against heels such as [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Remo](@/w/remo.md).

#### Feud wih Bad Bones

Later on Taras - alongside his partners from PAKA - got involved in a feud against [Bad Bones](bad-bones.md), who was then trying to destroy Pawłowski and his federation from inside. Taras was beaten up and injured after one of the training sessions held at [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md) by annonymous attacker - which was revealed to be [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) almost 2 years later. Taras and Bad Bones feud was ended by defeat of polish wrestler at [PTW x RyuCon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md).

#### Feud with Pure Gold

Not long after his defeat in a match with Bad Bones Taras and PAKA started a feud with Pure Gold - the team of [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - which would later evolve into a Tag Team Tournament for [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). They lost a Tag Team Match against Pure Gold at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), but they managed to advance into the finals of Tag Team Tournament while still feuding with Pure Gold, and newly formed heel faction: Legia Łysych. Taras and Pablo ultimatevly won [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) in a Tables Match against Pure Gold at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md).

#### Championship reign

PAKA made their first title defence at [PTW x RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) where they faced Budapest Bastards. They emerged victorious, but after a attack from Legia Łysych which caused the match to be ruled no-contest by the Referee. After that Taras got involved in fighting off Legia Łysych - [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) as well as Gabriel Queen in a six-man tag team match at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) as well as some exhibition matches. He did not defended his championship up until [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), where he and Pablo faced Budapest Bastards, MxM Collection and Sinister Kingdom. PAKA had ultimatevly lost the PTW Tag Team Championship to Budapest Bastards.

#### Final feuds and departure

After post-Gold Rush reveal that Wiktor Longman was the one who attacked Taras almost 2 years prior Wiktor announced that he will destroy Pawłowski and his allies from PAKA. Since Boro was already seriously injured by him previously, his next target was Taras. At [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) member of PAKA eventually lost and got injured by Wiktor Longman to such degree, that he had to be carried out on a stretcher. It was the final apperance of Taras in PTW's ring.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

#### Surprise debut and finishing the PAKA

Taras made his debut during [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). During music chairs contest held by Disco Pablo he barged into the ring masked and viciously attacked both Pablo and [Piotr Małecki](@/w/piotr-malecki.md). After unmasking himself he finished off Pablo with GTS and put Piotr through a table.
In his instagram stories Taras made references, that he was supposedly abadoned by his partners almost 8 months ago - possibly making references to him being attacked at Underground 21 - and declaring that PAKA has been officially disbanded.
