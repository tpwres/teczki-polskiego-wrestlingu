## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

#### Debut and mercenary role

Wiktor Longman made his debut in professional wrestling at [PTW Underground 7](@/e/ptw/2022-08-28-ptw-underground-7.md) where he quickly defeated [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md). He debuted as a mercenary-type heel persona. After a series of quick victories he got briefly "hired" by [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) to attack and injure his oponent, [Samson](@/w/samson.md), during contract signing before [PTW 3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). After their tag-team defeat against PAKA at [Underground 10](@/e/ptw/2023-01-28-ptw-underground-10.md), he turned against his employer. 

#### Alliance with Bad Bones & Feud with Pawłowski

Later on Longman got involved in a feud with one of the babyfaces - [Rafi Rartyas](@/w/rafi.md) - who was constantly bothering him to change his perspective and join his so-called "Power of friendship". After one of the post-match attacks on Rafi, [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) intervened to stop him. This led to Longman starting a feud with Pawłowski - joining his real-life friend [Bad Bones](@/w/bad-bones.md) in a crusade against the PTW owner. During that time he constantly eliminated PTW's faces - first Rafi, whom he piledrove at [PTW 4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), and then [Boro](@/w/boro.md), who was storyline-injured by Longman at [Underground 17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md) and never returned to PTW. 

At [PTW 5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) Longman took part in the Gold Rush Rumble Match for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), but got eliminated by [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md). He appeared once again near the end of the show, where he interrupted Pawłowski's engagement to his girlfriend. He showed a video, proving that he and Bad Bones were in fact working together alongside Marcin Rzeźniczek to bring Pawłowski down. After that he attacked the PTW owner and made him leave the ring on a stretcher.

After eventually scrapping the Rzeźnik angle due to his departure from PTW, the feud pivoted into Pawłowski & PAKA vs Longman storyline. At [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) Longman admitted that he was the one behind every PAKA injury (both the off-screen attack on Taras in 2022 and Boro's deliberate injury). He vowed to finish PAKA off and made flirty remarks towards Pawłowski's girlfriend, Karolina. This prompted Pawłowski to storm the ring and get physical with Longman, but they got separated by security. Later that night Longman injured [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and set up his match against [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) at [Total Blast from the Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md). His victory over Pablo at that show marks his last apperance in Prime Time Wrestling.

Shortly after Total Blast from the Past, Longman joined many other PTW talents and [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in June 2024.

Longman also made a few apperances abroad, most notably working alongside [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md) and [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md) in the Hungarian federation HCW.

### PpW Ewenement (2024)

Longman made his return in October 2024 at [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), when he entered as the final, mystery partner of [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md) in the Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) - seemingly leaning towards his old "mercenary" gimmick. After Zmowa's defeat he was blamed by [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) for their loss in said match, which was a set up for their predicted match in future.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

Initially Longman was supposed to challenge the [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) Gustav Gryffin in te main event of [Legacy of Wrestling's](@/o/low.md) [debut show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). However, due to personal reasons he was pulled off the card and didn't appear at the show.
