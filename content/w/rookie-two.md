Although he didn't have an official debut yet, Rookie Two had a few fights at KPW shows. He made his first appearance at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md), where he faced [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) in a 3-on-1 Handicap Match, alongside [Rookie One](@/w/rookie-one.md) and [Rookie Three](@/w/rookie-three.md). The fan-given name "Rookie Two" originated at this event, as the rookies weren't individually introduced.
