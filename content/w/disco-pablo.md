## Professional wrestling career 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut and PAKA formation

Disco Pablo left [Mine City Wrestling](@/o/mcw.md) to join [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), a new federation owned by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), early in its development. During training and preparations he was paired with [Boro](@/w/boro.md) and [Taras](@/w/taras.md) as a trio called PAKA (loosely _The PACK_). They were portrayed as laid-back babyfaces who'd known each other since childhood. Pablo was portrayed as the main party rocker of PAKA, often using dance in his matches.

Pablo made his debut at PTW's first show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) where he teamed up with ex-WWE wrestler [Santino](@/w/santino.md) against [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and Marius Al-Ani. Despite their loss they stood tall after beating up cocky Dziedzic in a post-match segment. For the first few shows, PAKA focused on establishing themselves as babyfaces and Pawłowski's favourites against heels such as [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), Dziedzic and [Remo](@/w/remo.md).

#### Feud with Bad Bones

Later on Pablo - alongside his partners from PAKA - got involved in a feud with [Bad Bones](@/w/bad-bones.md), who was then trying to destroy Pawłowski and his federation from the inside. Pablo's best friend - Taras - was beaten up and injured after one of the training sessions held at the [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md) by an annonymous attacker - who, almost two years later, was revealed to be [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md). At [Underground 4](@/e/ptw/2022-04-24-ptw-underground-4.md) Pablo was defeated by Bad Bones in a Singles Match.

#### Feud with Pure Gold

At [Ryucon](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md) in 2022, Disco Pablo and [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) faced Pure Gold ([Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)), but were defeated. This slowly started a feud between PAKA and Pure Gold, which led to their match at [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), which was won by Pure Gold. The rivalry continued and evolved into a Tag Team Tournament for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). PAKA managed to advance to the finals of the Tag Team Tournament while still feuding with Pure Gold, and the newly-formed heel faction, Legia Łysych ([Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)). Taras and Pablo ultimately won the PTW Tag Team Championship in a Tables Match against Pure Gold at [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md).

#### Championship reign

PAKA made their first title defence at [PTW x Ryucon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) where they faced [Budapest Bastards](@/tt/budapest-bastards.md). They emerged victorious, but afterwards an attack from Legia Łysych caused the match to be ruleda no-contest by the referee. After that Pablo got involved in fighting off Legia Łysych and Gabriel Queen in a six-man tag team match at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md), as well as some exhibition matches. He did not defend his championship until Gold Rush, where he and Taras faced Budapest Bastards, MxM Collection and [Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md). PAKA ultimately lost the PTW Tag Team Championship to Budapest Bastards.

#### Final feuds and departure

After the post-Gold Rush reveal that Wiktor Longman was the one who attacked Taras almost two years prior, Longman announced that he would destroy Pawłowski and his allies from PAKA. Since Boro was already seriously injured by him previously, his next target was Taras. At [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) the member of PAKA eventually lost to and was injured by Wiktor Longman to such a degree, that Taras had to be carried out on a stretcher. He made a save, but just after the damage was done. This led to Pablo vs Longman No Holds Barred Match at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), which was won by Longman. This marks Pablo's last appearance in PTW, as he [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) soon after.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-)

After Pablo's departure from PTW, he returned to the ring after a five-month hiatus in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at their show [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), where he lost to Olgierd. He also participated in a Battle Royal, won by the newcomer [Tony "The Riverman" Sheen](@/w/riverman.md). At MZW's [next show](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) Pablo faced Tony Sheen one-on-one, but his fight was interrupted by Taras who distracted him to allow Sheen to hit his finisher and score a victory. After the match Taras attempted to beat down Pablo with a kendo stick, but he was quickly chased off by babyfaces.

Later on he continued to make appearances in MZW, working as a babyface. At [Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md) he reunited with his ex-PAKA teammate Boro to face [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) in a Tag Team Match.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-)

#### Feud with Taras

Disco Pablo joined [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) - a federation created mostly by ex-PTW wrestlers and staff - shortly after they formed in mid-2024. At their [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) Pablo held a musical chairs contest, but during the game the masked Taras barged into the ring and viciously attacked both Pablo and [Piotr Małecki](@/w/piotr-malecki.md). After unmasking himself he finished off Pablo with a GTS and put Piotr through a table. In his Instagram stories, Taras stated that he was supposedly abadoned by his partners almost eight months ago - possibly referring to him being attacked at Underground 21 - and declared that PAKA had been officially disbanded.

At [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) Taras and Pablo faced each other in a promo segment, where Taras reiterated that it was Pablo who abadoned him first, thus destroying PAKA. After an exchange of blows, Pablo oficially challenged Taras to a match at Legacy's next show. The feud concluded at [Legacy vol. 3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) where he finally defeated his ex-brother with Boro serving as a special guest referee.
