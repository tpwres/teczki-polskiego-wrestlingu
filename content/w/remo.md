## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

Remo joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) very early in its development and received his in-ring training in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md). He made his debut at PTW's first show - [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) as a villainous "Lone Wolf" persona, but was defeated by Arczi Czajka. Remo's first stint in PTW lasted until [Underground 5](@/e/ptw/2022-05-29-ptw-underground-5.md). Shortly after, he suffered a knee injury, which sidelined him from competition for over nine months.

Remo made his return at [Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md) where he attacked [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) before his match against [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), possibly teasing their feud. Unfortunately for him, he was injured once again.

In June 2024 Remo officialy [left Prime Time Wrestling](@/a/ptw-exits.md), which he announced via his social media.
