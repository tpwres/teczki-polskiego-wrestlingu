## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Training and debut as Rookie Oskar

Oskar Alexander started his wrestling training in [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) - a training facility operated mostly by PpW-affiliated wrestlers, with [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) as the head coach.
In the span of a few months he became ready for his in-ring debut.
He debuted as Adept Oskar (_Rookie Oskar_) in a "Young Lion" gimmick highly influenced by his namesake - the German wrestler [Oskar Leube][oskar-leube]. In a similar fashion to Japanese Young Lions, he wore plain black trunks and boots, and used a limited but powerful moveset.

Oskar made his debut as one of the contenders in Johnny Blade's Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match at [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md). He became the first wrestler to make his in-ring debut after being trained solely in Ewenement Dojo.

#### Becoming Oskar Alexander

After his victory over [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), in a post-match promo he declared that he earned the right to decide what his ringname would be. Since then he's been billed as "Oskar Alexander". At the same show, in a backstage interview, he became affiliated with an unnamed female ["Talent Agent"](@/w/agentka-agatka.md), who became his manager.

Besides his regular appearances as Oskar Alexander he also performed as "Oskar Strong" - [Biesiad Strong's](@/w/biesiad.md) parody - at the non-canon [SplatFilmFest](@/e/ppw/2024-10-30-ppw-chcemy-krwi.md) show.

In January 2025 Oskar Alexander faced a Polish scene legend - [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - at [PpW Gruba Przesada](@c/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), in probably the biggest match in his career up to that point. During the 20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) Oskar suffered an injury after receiving a Stallion Cutter from [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) face-first onto a championship belt laying in the ring, which caused him to bleed severely. Despite that, he quickly recovered and managed to support Agentka Agatka in her first match against Madison Marley. 

#### Joining Vic Golden

At [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) Oskar took part in a [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) #1 Contender Ladder Match, but he was unsucessful in winning it. Later that same night he surprisingly intervened in a match between [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and Vic Golden, helping the Polish wrestling legend to secure a victory over Queen. In a post-match interview he confirmed that he and Agentka Agatka would join Golden, forming an alliance. 

### MZW (2025-)

#### Debut

Alexander made his [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) debut at [Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md), thus becoming the first [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) graduate to debut outside of PpW.
Taking part in a tournament for a championship contract briefcase, he was set to face [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md). He cut a lengthy promo on his way to the ring, insulting the city of Wrocław, the audience and Shadow himself. Before managing to go on the offensive, however, he was quickly rolled up for a pin and lost the match in a matter of seconds.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025-)

#### Road to the title

Alexander made his [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) debut at [Legacy of Wrestling vol.3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) in a _Road to the Title_ triple threat match against [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md). Ultimately, he failed to qualify in the tournament, with Queen emerging the winner.
