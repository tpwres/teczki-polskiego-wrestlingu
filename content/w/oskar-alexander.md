## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Training and debut as Rookie Oskar

Oskar Alexander started his wrestling training in [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) - a training facility operated mostly by PpW-affiliated wrestlers, with [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) as the head coach.
In the span of a few months he became ready for his in-ring debut.
He debuted as Adept Oskar (_Rookie Oskar_) in a "Young Lion" gimmick highly influenced by his namesake - the German wrestler [Oskar Leube][oskar-leube]. In a similar fashion to Japanese Young Lions, he wore plain black trunks and boots, and used a limited but powerful moveset.

Oskar made his debut as one of the contenders in Johnny Blade's Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match at [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md). He became the first wrestler to make his in-ring debut after being trained solely in Ewenement Dojo.

#### Becoming Oskar Alexander

After his victory over [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), in a post-match promo he declared that he earned the right to decide what his ringname would be. Since then he's been billed as "Oskar Alexander". At the same show, in a backstage interview, he became affiliated with an unnamed female ["Talent Agent"](@/w/agentka-agatka.md), who became his manager.

Besides his regular appearances as Oskar Alexander he also performed as "Oskar Strong" - [Biesiad Strong's](@/w/biesiad.md) parody - at the non-canon [SplatFilmFest](@/e/ppw/2024-10-30-ppw-chcemy-krwi.md) show.

In January 2025 Oskar Alexander faced a Polish scene legend - [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - at [PpW Gruba Przesada](@c/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), in probably the biggest match in his career up to that point. During the 20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) Oskar suffered an injury after receiving a Stallion Cutter from [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) face-first onto a championship belt laying in the ring, which caused him to bleed severely. Despite that, he quickly recovered and managed to support Agentka Agatka in her first match against Madison Marley. 

#### Joining Vic Golden

At [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) Oskar took part in a [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) #1 Contender Ladder Match, but he was unsucessful in winning it. Later that same night he surprisingly intervened in a match between [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and Vic Golden, helping the Polish wrestling legend to secure a victory over Queen. In a post-match interview he confirmed that he and Agentka Agatka would join Golden, forming an alliance. 

### MZW (2025-)

#### Debut

Alexander made his [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) debut at [Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md), thus becoming the first [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) graduate to debut outside of PpW.
Taking part in a tournament for a championship contract briefcase, he was set to face [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md). He cut a lengthy promo on his way to the ring, insulting the city of Wroc≈Çaw, the audience and Shadow himself. Before managing to go on the offensive, however, he was quickly rolled up for a pin and lost the match in a matter of seconds.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025-)

#### Road to the title

Alexander made his [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) debut at [Legacy of Wrestling vol.3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) in a _Road to the Title_ triple threat match against [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md). Ultimately, he failed to qualify in the tournament, with Queen emerging the winner.
