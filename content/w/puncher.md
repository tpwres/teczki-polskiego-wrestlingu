## Professional wrestling career

### 2024: Criticizing the PTW Exits

_See also: [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md)._

Puncher became the inaugural PTW champion at [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), in a Royal Rumble style match.
On the following [Underground show](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) he also became champion of the sister promotion WWA, winning the belt from Marius Al-Ani.

After the events of Gold Rush, talent started leaving the company, which spurred Puncher's activity in social media, sometimes resulting in quite hostile comments.

On June 5th, he tweeted about a "purge night" happening, indirectly referencing an upcoming wave of releases.
The next Monday June 10th, just two days after [Ledwo Legalne 4](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), which saw not only Legia Łysych but also other talent leaving,
he declared that "weeds have now been pulled out".
During the following days, he continued to refer to now ex-PTW talent as "weeds", leaking backstage stories of them allegedly being snitches (primarily [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)).
He updated his social media bio text, calling himself a "moral compass of Polish wrestling", and declaring a vision of "Polish wrestling ONLY with borders".

#### "Herd Instinct"

On June 18th, 2024, Puncher published a single-page comic titled "Owczy Pęd" (_Herd Instinct_). With extremely high attention to detail, it depicted some of the ex-PTW talent as sheep,
leading other sheep (possibly referring to fans) into a pig's gaping anus, representing [PpW](@/o/ppw.md).
