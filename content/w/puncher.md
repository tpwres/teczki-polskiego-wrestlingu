## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-present)

#### Training and debut

Puncher started training after being encouraged to do so by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) owner: [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). He was one of the project-wrestlers of Pan Pawłowski. During the early days of Prime Time Wrestling Arkadiusz tried to attract many niche influencers and sportsmen to wrestling in order to grow both their careers, help PTW's media presence and build audience interest. Puncher was one of the sportsmen who managed to continue his pro-wrestling training regularly.

Puncher made his debut in PTW's ring at their first show - [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) - where he took part in Battle Royal Match. He quickly got established as one of the most pushed villains - performing as cocky boxer who is able to knock-out everyone with one good punch. 

#### Feud with Robert Star

For a good part of 2022 Puncher was running a undefeated streak eliminating every opponent on his way - with simmulatneusly evolving his gimmick into "anti-influencer" and "anti-clown" persona, with frequent promos, which were positively received by the crowd. His streak came to an end when he started a rivalry against [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), who costed him a match against [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md). This led to their match at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) where he defeated Robert in a questionable way after knocking-out [Referee Rafał](@/w/alex-brave.md). This allowed to continue their rivalry for the next months. During that time they were forced to work together as a tag team at [Underground 11](@/e/ptw/2023-01-29-ptw-underground-11.md) where they got defeated by Arrows Of Hungary. At [Underground 15](@/e/ptw/2023-05-28-ptw-underground-15.md) Puncher brutally assaulted [Hunyadi Tamas](@/w/hunyadi-tamas.md) - Robert's tag team partner and friend - which heated up build-up for their match at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md). Robert managed to win this match and defend his Dansk Pro Wrestling Championship in said match and left company shortly after, ultimately ending their feud.

#### PTW Champion 

After his feud with Star ended Puncher continued his victory streak marking himself as one of the most serious contenders to [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md)
Puncher became the inaugural PTW champion at [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), in a Gold Rush Rumble Match.

On the following [Underground show](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) he also became champion of the sister promotion WWA, winning the belt from Marius Al-Ani.

At [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) Puncher faced ex-WWE polish-nigerian wrestler Babathunder - the match was ruled as no-contest due to intervention from Sinister Kingdom. This ending was one of the main negative points of the show, which resulted in huge backlash from fans. 

#### Criticizing the PTW Exits

_See also: [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md)._

After the events of Total Blast, talent started leaving the company, which spurred Puncher's activity in social media, sometimes resulting in quite hostile comments.

On June 5th, he tweeted about a "purge night" happening, indirectly referencing an upcoming wave of releases.
The next Monday June 10th, just two days after [Ledwo Legalne 4](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), which saw not only Legia Łysych but also other talent leaving,
he declared that "weeds have now been pulled out".
During the following days, he continued to refer to now ex-PTW talent as "weeds", leaking backstage stories of them allegedly being snitches (primarily [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)).
He updated his social media bio text, calling himself a "moral compass of Polish wrestling", and declaring a vision of "Polish wrestling ONLY with borders".

On June 18th, 2024, Puncher published a single-page comic titled "Owczy Pęd" (_Herd Instinct_). With extremely high attention to detail, it depicted some of the ex-PTW talent as sheep,
leading other sheep (possibly referring to fans) into a pig's gaping anus, representing [PpW](@/o/ppw.md).

Commentary booth: Arek Paterek, referred to as "Świderek" ("świder" meaning a type of drill, similar in appearance to a pig's tail), Piotr "ShowOff" Małecki, referred to as "ŚwińOff" (_PigOff_), and likely Łukasz Baliński. \
The horse: "The Polish Stallion" [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), and to his right Golden and Queen again, ushering the other sheep into the pig's anus. \

#### PTW's reboot

After Pan Pawłowski announced that at [PTW x RyuCon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md) a soft reboot will take place Puncher managed to hold his position as PTW's top heel and a Champion. However, due to online altercations Puncher reputation among fans have worsened.

At [PTW Underground 24: Bania U Prezesa](@/e/ptw/2024-11-16-ptw-underground-24.md) Puncher put new PTW co-owner - Łukasz Okoński - through a table, which resulted in a financial punishment ordered by Pawłowski, which was announced at [Underground 25](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md). At the same show Puncher barged into the ring and confronted Pawłowski in a work-shoot promo, where he called PTW owner a liar and "no messiah of polish wrestling" Pawłowski claims to be. Arkadiusz responded by calling Puncher a "ungrateful son of a bitch" and claiming that he regrets making him a face of Prime Time Wrestling. In a main event, where Puncher was defending his championship against [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) Pawłowski interrupted and turned heel by hitting Spartan with a chair, ultimatevly helping Puncher defend his PTW Championship.
