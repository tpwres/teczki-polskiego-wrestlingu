He adopted a babyface persona of "The King of Spanish Wrestling". In his first match he defeated [Erik Slotir](@/w/erik-slotir.md). Since then he made a series of semi-regular apperances on the next Underground shows. He was defeated by [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md), and defeated [Sędzia Rafał](@/w/alex-brave.md) at the [next show](@/e/ptw/2023-12-10-ptw-underground-20.md).
