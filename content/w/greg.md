Greg is one of the most experienced [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestlers, and along with [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), one of only three still in active roster to come out of [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).
In DDW he started with a rapper gimmick. This can be seen in a promo video, where he [challenges Robert Star][greg-rap] for their fight at [DDW House Show #2](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md).

At first typically placed in the mid-card, Greg slowly but surely started gaining popularity, in no small part thanks to his memorable promos shot at increasingly later hours of the night, until he eventually started appearing in main events. At [KPW OldTown 2](@/e/kpw/2017-07-23-kpw-oldtown-2.md) Greg became the inaugural [OldTown Champion](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) and held the title for nearly two years.

Greg was announced as "the best pupil of [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md)", and was a member of the heel stable Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_), since it started in DDW.
He was frequently present at ringside for Kawaler's matches, and the two often used heel tactics like distracting the referee while the rest of the faction punishes Kawaler's opponent.

At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) Greg betrayed and attacked the already-defeated [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), who up to this point was the leader of Kawaleria.
Following that incident, Greg anointed himself the pope of Polish wrestling, Pijus I (roughly _Drinkus I_, but also a reference to Pius, a popular papal name).
This has been his gimmick ever since. As Pope Pijus, his entrance routine has him enter dressed in long monasterial robes with a hood, and walk around the ring presenting a signet ring to fans, who are allowed to bow down and kiss it.
Initially, he was also accompanied by [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) who wore a surplice, as his junior priest or altar boy. Sometimes, during the match, Chemik would go around the ring, collecting donations into a wicker basket tray, mimicking a custom from a Catholic Mass.
Greg also became the leader of a new heel faction named Gałąź Gregoriańska (_The Gregorian Branch_), which can be seen as the new version of Kawaleria. This faction also includes Chemik, [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) and [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md).

At [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) Greg defeated David Oliwa to win the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), vacated when [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) left KPW to join [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). Eleven months later he lost the title to Red Scorpion.
