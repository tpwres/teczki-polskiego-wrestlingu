Greg is one of the most experienced [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestlers, and along with [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), one of only three still in active roster to come out of [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).

At first typically placed in the mid-card, Greg slowly but surely started gaining popularity, in no small part thanks to his memorable promos shot at increasingly later hours of the night, until he eventually started appearing in main events. At [KPW OldTown 2](@/e/kpw/2017-07-23-kpw-oldtown-2.md) Greg became the inaugural [OldTown Champion](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) and held the title for nearly two years.

At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) Greg betrayed and attacked the already-defeated [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), who up to this point was the leader of the heel stable Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_), of which Greg was a member. Following that incident, Greg anointed himself the pope of Polish wrestling, Pijus I (roughly _Drinkus I_, but also a reference to Pius, a popular papal name). This has been his gimmick ever since.

At [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) Greg defeated David Oliwa and won the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), vacated when [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) left KPW to join [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). Eleven months later he lost the title to Red Scorpion.
