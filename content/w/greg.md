## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

GREG debuted in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in October 2013 at [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md) in a Battle Royal. Later, in August 2014 during [Rookie Showcase](@/e/ddw/2014-08-16-ddw-pokaz-adeptow.md) event, he teamed up with Wielki G as "Double G" to face - and lose to - [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and Kamil Leśny. Initially he worked as babyface with a rapper gimmick. This can be seen in a promo video, where he [challenges Robert Star][greg-rap] for their fight at [DDW House Show #2](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md). He made a total of six appearances. At DDW's [final show at Baltikon](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md) he officially joined Kawaleria - a villainous stable led by Piękny Kawaler.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

Greg is one of the most experienced [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestlers, and along with [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), one of only three still in active roster to come out of [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).

#### Kawaleria

Greg was announced as "the best pupil of [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md)", and was a member of the heel stable Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_).
He was frequently present at ringside for Kawaler's matches, and the two often used heel tactics like distracting the referee while the rest of the faction punishes Kawaler's opponent.
At first typically placed in the mid-card, Greg slowly but surely started gaining popularity, in no small part thanks to his memorable promos shot at increasingly later hours of the night, until he eventually started appearing in main events. He often teamed up with another Kawaleria members, such as [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md), [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) and Kawaler himself.

#### KPW OldTown Champion

At [KPW OldTown 2](@/e/kpw/2017-07-23-kpw-oldtown-2.md) Greg became the inaugural [OldTown Champion](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) by defeating [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md) and held the title for nearly two years, defending it in a matches against wrestlers such as [Fynn Freyhart](@/w/fynn-freyhart.md), [Lee Rogers](@/w/lee-rogers.md) and Tristan Archer. He eventually lost it to [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) in an "I Quit" Match at [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md).

#### The Pope of Polish Wrestling

At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) Greg betrayed and attacked the already-defeated [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), who up to this point was the leader of Kawaleria.
Following that incident, Greg anointed himself the Pope of Polish wrestling, Pijus I (roughly _Drinkus I_, but also a reference to Pius, a popular papal name).
This has been his gimmick ever since. As Pope Pijus, his entrance routine has him enter dressed in long monasterial robes with a hood, and walk around the ring presenting a signet ring to fans, who are allowed to bow down and kiss it.
Initially, he was also accompanied by [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) who wore a surplice, as his junior priest or altar boy. Sometimes, during the match, Chemik would go around the ring, collecting donations into a wicker basket tray, mimicking a custom from a Catholic Mass.
Greg also became the leader of a new heel faction named [Gałąź Gregoriańska](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md) (_The Gregorian Branch_), which could be seen as the new version of Kawaleria. This faction also included Chemik, [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) and [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md).

At [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) Greg defeated David Oliwa to win the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), vacated when [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) left KPW to join [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). Eleven months later he lost the title to [Red Scorpion](@/w/red-scorpion.md).

#### The end of the Gregorian Branch

At [Godzina Zero 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md) Greg lost his match against [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md). After the match, he was attacked with a chair to the back by Rosetti, who was angry with Greg for the way he dismissed Rosetti's loss of the KPW Old Town Championship to Chemik at [Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md). A few moments later, Chemik and Eryk Lesak rushed into the ring and chased Rosetti away, only to unexpectedly turn on Greg themselves, thus ending the Gregorian Branch. With Greg out of the ring, they cut a short promo about how when they joined the branch, Greg was someone estabilished, a true leader - but now, after his losing streak, he was no longer worth following.

This betrayal led to his rivalry with Rosetti, which resulted in a double-count out draw in a KPW Championship Contendership Qualifying Match at [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md). During the same show [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) was attacked and his role of KPW's Chairman was taken over by Rosetti himself (supposedly acting in accordance with Malinowski's wishes). The acting chairman quickly set up a Handicap Match with himself and KPW's new powerhouse Tomczak against Greg, but during [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md) Rosetti pulled himself out of the match (citing being overwhelmed with his new managerial duties), leaving Tomczak alone against Greg, but putting every obstacle possible just to see his former leader lose against the debutant. Greg did lose the match, the side effect of which was him turning babyface.

His face turn was made clear at [Arena 28](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) where he was getting plenty of pop, and during the new chairman induction ceremony he visibly sided with other babyfaces; then at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md) after [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) won the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), Greg joined him and other faces in celebration of the new Champion. However, since the turn Greg hasn't yet shown a new direction for his character, remaining a "good guy" version of Pope Pijus I.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025)

On 17.03.2025, it was confirmed that Greg and another legend of Polish wrestling scene, [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), would face each other at [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md). This match is the [Legacy](@/o/low.md) debut for both of them.
