## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Debut

Serg Sullivan joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), working as a villainous masked persona. He debuted at [Halloweenowy Łomot](@/e/ptw/2024-10-19-ptw-underground-23.md) in an International Showcase Triple Threat Match against the victorious [Rust](@/w/rust.md), and Mikk Vainula. At [Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md) he faced [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) in his in-ring debut (with Okoński introduced as El Homo).

#### Feud with Miyagi Shida

At [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) Serg lost in a Triple Threat Match, won by [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md). This led to their Singles Match at [Wiosenna Bijatyka](@/e/ptw/2025-03-15-ptw-wiosenna-bijatyka.md), which resulted in Serge's disqualification, for attacking Shida with a solid steel briefcase.
This heated up their rivalry, leading to a huge brawl after Shida's match at [Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md), which lasted throughout the whole show. The heated rivalry lasted up until [Apokalipsa](@/e/ptw/2025-08-30-ptw-apokalipsa.md) where Serg was finally defeated by Shida in a Casket Match.
