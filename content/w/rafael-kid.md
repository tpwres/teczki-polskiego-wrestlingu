## Professional wrestling career

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2017)

Rafael Kid started his career as a Revage, being one of the original members of Toruń-based [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md). He made his debut at [DFW first show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md) in June 2015 and held his position as a regular wrestler. He frequently fought against [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) early in his career. At [DFW Tournament Of Dreams I](@/e/dfw/2016-06-11-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-1.md) he participated in a quarter finals match for [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md) but he was defeated. He finally managed to win the championship from hands of his rival in April 2017 at [Recent Dreams](@/e/dfw/2017-04-23-dfw-recent-dreams.md). His last match in DFW took place at [DFW Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md) where he defeated [Direk](@/w/direk.md) in a Falls Count Anywhere Street Fight. His title reign lasted up until his departure from DFW in late 2017, leaving the Championship vacated.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2017-2021)

Rafael started training at MZW Academy back in Głuchołazy along with some other DFW talent while still performing in Dream Factory Wrestling. During that time he made occasional apperances as both ring announcer and referee where it was required. After training there for some time he has decided to transfer to [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) officially. He debuted there in December 2017 where he took part in Ten Man Battle Royal Match at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) where he performed under his real-life name. From 2018 onwards he started performing under "Rafael Kid" gimmick - portraying a classic young and agile babyface - and started making regular apperances during MZW's ["Project"](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) era. He made his apperances on every single one of said shows. He fought in a [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) tournament final at [MZW Project 2: Four](@/e/mzw/2018-12-08-mzw-project-2-four.md) but he did not succedeed. 

For best part of 2018 and 2019 he performed mostly in multi-man and midcard matches. Around that time period he also become one of the members of ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md) group. During pandemy he starred in MZW's taped show called [Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md). After lockdown - at [Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) - Rafael managed to defeat [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) in semi-final, and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) in a final match for vacant MZW Championship. His reign as MZW Champion looked similar to his DFW Championship reign - Rafael Kid vacated the title after leaving the federaiton. Nevertheless his reign is still recognized as the longest one in history - lasting for 574 days. 

### PpW Ewenement (2022)

Rafael Kid made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [PpW Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md) where he faced - and got defeated by - his fellow ex-DFW and MZW collegue [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). He was scheduled to face Aytac Bahar, but he got unexpectedly pulled off from the card. After that he subsequently retired from wrestling.
