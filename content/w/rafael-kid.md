## Professional wrestling career

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2017)

Rafael Kid started his career as a Revage, being one of the founding members of Toruń-based [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md). He made his debut at [DFW's first show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md) in June 2015, regularly appearing at each show. He frequently fought against [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) early in his career. At [Tournament Of Dreams I](@/e/dfw/2016-06-11-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-1.md) Revage participated in a quarter finals match for the [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md), losing to Hunter. He finally managed to win the championship from the hands of his rival in April 2017 at [Recent Dreams](@/e/dfw/2017-04-23-dfw-recent-dreams.md). Revage's last match in DFW took place at [DFW Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md) where he defeated [Direk](@/w/direk.md) in a Falls Count Anywhere Street Fight. Revage's title reign lasted up until his departure from DFW in late 2017, leaving the Championship vacated.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2017-2021)

Revage started training at the MZW Academy back in Głuchołazy along with some other DFW talent, while still performing in Dream Factory Wrestling. During that time he made occasional appearances as both ring announcer and referee, as needed. After training there for some time, he decided to transfer to [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) officially. Revage debuted there in December 2017, taking part in a Ten Man Battle Royal Match at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) where he performed under his real-life name. From 2018 onwards he started performing under a new "Rafael Kid" gimmick - portraying a classic young and agile babyface - and started making regular appearances during MZW's ["Project"](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) era, fighting at every show in this series. He participated in a [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) tournament final at [Project 2: Four](@/e/mzw/2018-12-08-mzw-project-2-four.md), losing to [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md).

For the better part of 2018 and 2019, Kid performed mostly in multi-man and midcard matches. Around that time period he also become one of the members of ["The Greens"](@/tt/zieloni.md) group. During the COVID-19 pandemic Rafael starred in MZW's taped show called [Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md), where once again he appeared at every event. After the lockdowns ended, at [Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) Rafael managed to defeat [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) in the semi-finals, and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) in the final match for the vacant [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). His reign as the MZW Champion turned out similar to his DFW Championship reign - Rafael Kid vacated the title after leaving the federation. Nevertheless, his reign is still recognized as the longest one in history - lasting for 574 days, with the title being officialy vacated on the day of [Game ON](@/e/mzw/2023-03-11-mzw-game-on.md).

### PpW Ewenement (2022)

Rafael Kid made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [PpW Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md), losing to his fellow ex-DFW and MZW collegue [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Kid was scheduled to face Aytac Bahar, however he was unexpectedly pulled off from the card. After that, Kid retired from wrestling.

## International wrestling appearances

In 2019 Rafael made a one-off appearance for Next Step Wrestling in Germany, where he worked in a tag team match alongside [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md).
