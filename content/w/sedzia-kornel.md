## Professional wrestling career

### 2022: Debut and feuding with Kapitan Bazooka

Kornel made his official [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) debut as a referee during [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) in November 2022.
After the second match of the evening, he got into a scuffle with also-debuting [Kapitan Bazooka](@/w/kapitan-bazooka.md), who then laid him out with an Attitude Adjustment, writing him off for the rest of the night.
Kornel later addressed the attack in an [interview segment][kornel-interview], where he called Bazooka's actions unprofessional and an attack on Polish wrestling.
This set up a feud between the two, that continued mostly on social media channels throughout 2023.
It culminated at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu](@/e/ppw/2023-11-24-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu.md) a year later, where Kornel's American cousin, Kapral Kornel, defeated Kapitan Bazooka in a singles match.

### 2023: Feuding with Gustav Gryffin, "Hardcore Referee"

Kornel also entered into a lengthy feud with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md).
Unhappy with his officiating, Gustav derogatorily called Kornel a "skinny dog" in a promo at [Ledwo Legalne III](@/e/ppw/2023-06-17-ppw-ledwo-legalne-3.md), and refused to have his matches refereed by Kornel.
This resulted in [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) officiating Gryffin's match against [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md) at [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md), and continued into Gryffin's career with other referees officiating his matches.

At [Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md) Kornel was introduced as a "referee well-versed in hardcore", and officiated a hardcore match between [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) and Chris X.
This experience in hardcore and deathmatches, as well as a history of taking ref bumps, sometimes resulting in bleeding (e.g. [Feager](@/w/feager.md) vs [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) at [PpW Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md)) earned him the nickname "Hardcore Referee". He later put that on a T-shirt, thus becoming the second Polish referee to sell his merchandise (after [Krystian Czekaj](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md)).
