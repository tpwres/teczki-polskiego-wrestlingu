## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2022-present)

#### Debut and feuding with Kapitan Bazooka

Kornel made his official [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) debut as a referee during [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) in November 2022. For most of that time he worked alongside [Sędzia Borys](@/w/sedzia-borys.md).
After the second match of the evening, he got into a scuffle with also-debuting [Kapitan Bazooka](@/w/kapitan-bazooka.md), who then laid him out with an Attitude Adjustment, writing him off for the rest of the night.
Kornel later addressed the attack in an [interview segment][kornel-interview], where he called Bazooka's actions unprofessional and an attack on Polish wrestling.
This set up a feud between the two, that continued mostly on social media channels throughout 2023.
It culminated at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu](@/e/ppw/2023-11-24-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu.md) a year later, where Kornel's American cousin, Kapral Kornel, defeated Kapitan Bazooka in a singles match.

#### Feud with Gustav Gryffin, "Hardcore Referee"

Kornel also entered into a lengthy feud with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md).
Unhappy with his officiating, Gustav derogatorily called Kornel a "skinny dog" in a promo at [Ledwo Legalne III](@/e/ppw/2023-06-17-ppw-ledwo-legalne-3.md), and refused to have his matches refereed by Kornel.
This resulted in [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) officiating Gryffin's match against [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md) at [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md), and continued into Gryffin's career with other referees officiating his matches.

Around mid-2023 Kornel began to be introduced as a "referee well-versed in hardcore".
This experience in hardcore and deathmatches, as well as a history of taking ref bumps, sometimes resulting in bleeding (e.g. [Feager](@/w/feager.md) vs [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) at [PpW Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md)) earned him the nickname "Hardcore Referee". He later put that on a T-shirt, thus becoming the second Polish referee to sell his merchandise (after [Krystian Czekaj](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md)).

#### Feud with Olgierd

After [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), members of [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) - [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - blamed Kornel for their defeat at said show. In a post-match interview, Olgierd verbally and physically assaulted Kornel, and vowed that he would put all of PpW's referees back in line, as they were constantly interrupting him in his matches by enforcing rules. On February 2nd, 2025, it was officially announced that Olgierd would face each referee in a Gauntlet Match at [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md). Referee Kornel was the first one to go against the Polish hooligan.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023)

At [Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md) Kornel made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), and officiated a hardcore match between [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) and [Chris X](@/w/chris-x.md).
