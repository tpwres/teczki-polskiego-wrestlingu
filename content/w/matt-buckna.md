## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016-present)

#### Early appearances

Matt Buckna made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) back in November 2016 at [MZW Revolution](@/e/mzw/2016-11-05-mzw-revolution.md). His appearances were possible due to good working relations between MZW and the Dresden-based wrestling scene, especially Next Step Wrestling. For most of his time in MZW, he fought in Singles and Multi-Man matches as a special attraction, due to his Powerhouse style and rather big size. For the best part of this tenure he worked as tweener.

#### MZW Champion

Matt Buckna made his return to Poland shortly after MZW fully got back on track following the COVID-19 pandemic, now no longer a heavyweight, but significantly slimmer. At [MZW Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md) he defeated Michael Payne in an [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) #1 Contenders Match for the vacant title. His challenger in the final match for the Championship was [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), who was unsuccessful against the German wrestler. Thus, Matt Buckna became the new MZW Champion, turning babyface along the way.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025)

In July 2025, Matt Buckna was a surprise contender at the [third Legacy show](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md). When [Erik Šlotíř's](@/w/erik-slotir.md) manager [Arek Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) demanded a more challenging opponent for his client, Bahraini wrestler Yaqoob entered. After Paterek confronted acting chairman [Wiktor](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), he revealed Matt as a second opponent for Erik, making it a Triple Threat Match. Buckna then put his [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) on the line for this match, which he managed to retain with his trademark spear.
