## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2012-2014)

Dover made his debut in Poland working for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) at their two-day supershow in [Rzeszów](@/e/ddw/2012-03-09-ddw-6.md) and [Kolbuszowa](@/e/ddw/2012-03-10-ddw-7.md), where he worked in multi-man matches. After a year-long break DDW returned to hosting shows and invited Dover once again for their [next show](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md). His last appearance for DDW took place in August 2014, when he faced [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) in a Hardcore Match at [All Or Nothing II](@/e/ddw/2014-08-17-ddw-all-or-nothing-2.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015)

After DDW folded its operations and transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Dover made a single appearance at their first official show [KPW vs the World: Hung(a)ry for Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), where he faced and was defeated by [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023)

After over eight years of inactivity on the Polish wrestling scene, Dover - along with his tag team partner Icarus - appeared in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). They entered the tournament for the inaugural [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) and in the first round, which took place at [Underground 11](@/e/ptw/2023-01-29-ptw-underground-11.md), defeated a team of bitter enemies - [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) and [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md). In the semi-finals they were eliminated by PAKA ([Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and [Taras](@/w/taras.md)), which marked the end of their run in Prime Time Wrestling.
