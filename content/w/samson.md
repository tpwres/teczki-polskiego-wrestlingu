## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2023)

#### Debut and first feuds

Samson made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 4](@/e/ptw/2022-04-24-ptw-underground-4.md). He adopted a "Top Gun" persona, heavily inspired by the famous Tom Cruise movie of the same name. He portrayed a strictly babyface persona, and quickly gained a lot of popularity thanks to his agility and high-risk manouvers despite having a rather powerhouse physique. For most of 2022 he maintained a strong midcard position with an average win-loss record. Samson even got involved in a short feud against [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), who was set to face him at [PTW 3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). The plan was, however, scrapped after [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) - who was on Syriusz's payroll - attacked and injured Samson.

#### Samsonito and departure

In 2023 Samson maintained his position in the midcard of most PTW shows. A brief storyline with [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) emerged, when their match at [Underground 15](@/e/ptw/2023-05-28-ptw-underground-15.md) was disrupted by [Iskra](@/w/iskra.md). A rematch between the two took place at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md). At [PTW x Ryucon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md), he faced a member of Sinister Kingdom, [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md). He was then attacked by Dziedzic and [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), but they were chased off by Marcelito and [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). This led to Samson allying with Marcelito, to form "Samsonito", who then feuded with [Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md). The story was cut short, as Samson made his last appearance for PTW at [Underground 20](@/e/ptw/2023-12-10-ptw-underground-20.md) in December 2023.

Shortly after that last appearance, Samson [left PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md). In an interview published on the "Wrestling Polska" YouTube channel, Samson stated that his departure was caused by a dispute with PTW's owner [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) over finances and overall poor talent treatment from Pawłowski's side. The interview has since been taken down.

### PpW Ewenement (2024)

#### Debut

After his depature from PTW, Samson joined Warsaw-based [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) as part of the "Prime Time Transfers" deal made by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), followed later by other ex-PTW talent. He made his debut at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) where he defeated Asara and [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) in a Triple Threat Match. He then took part in another Three Way Match at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) where his victory was stolen from him by [Gustav's](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) personal trainer - [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md). His third, and fist singles match took place at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) where his opportunity to win the UEWA Championship from [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) was denied after his opponent hit a Low Blow on him.

#### Feud with Gustav Gryffin

Frustrated over being denied a victory twice by various shenanigans, Samson challenged Mister Z for a match at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md). He managed to win this fight and started a rivalry with Gustav Gryffin, recently crowned [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md).
They faced each other in a series of three matches. The first one at [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) was an non-title Match which ended in a double count-out. They faced each other again a month later at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) in an Anarchy Cyclone Tag-Team Match where Samson teamed up with [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) against Gustav and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Samson lost this match after being tied to the turnbuckle with leather straps by Gustav.
This led to the final match in their trilogy at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) where he finally faced Gustav in a Strap Match, with the PpW Championship on the line. He was unable to win this fight, losing by submission. In a post-match interview, he confessed that his self-esteem is seriously damaged, and that he would need some time off from PpW.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

Samson made a one-off appearance in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), where he faced [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) at [MZW No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) in October 2024.

## International appearances

In 2024 Samson, along with [Axel Fox](@/w/jakub.md) and other Polish talent, trained at WxW Academy in Gelsenkirchen, and worked as ring crew during their major 16 Carat Gold event in March in Oberhausen.
