## Professional wrestling career 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2023)

#### Debut and first feuds

Samson made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 4](@/e/ptw/2022-04-24-ptw-underground-4.md). He adopted a "Top Gun" persona, heavyly inspired by a famous movie with the same name. He was portraying strictly babyface persona, and he quickly gained a lot of popularity thanks to his in-ring style, where he was showing off his agility and high-risk manouvers while maintaining rather powerhouse physique. For most part of 2022 he maintained a strong midcard position with mixed results of fights. He even got involved in short feud against [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) who was set to face him at [PTW 3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) the plan was however scrapped after [Wiktor Longman](@/w/longman.md) - who was on Syriusz's payroll - attacked and injured Samson. 

#### Samsonito and departure

In 2023 Samson continued to occupy his spot in midcard of most PTW shows. He got engaged in short storyline with [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) when their match at [Underground 15](@/e/ptw/2023-05-28-ptw-underground-15.md) was disrupted by [Iskra](@/w/iskra.md). Marcelito and Samson rematch took place at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md). At the [PTW x RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) he faced member of Sinister Kingdom - [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md). He got attacked by Dziedzic and [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), but they were chased off by Marcelito and [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). Samson officialy formed an alliance with Marcelito to form "Samsonito" and got engaged in a feud with Sinister Kingdom. They plan was seemingly cut short, as Samson made his last apperance for PTW at [Underground 20](content/e/ptw/2023-12-10-ptw-underground-20.md) in December 2023.

Not long after his last apperance Samson [left PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md). In a interview published on "Wrestling Polska" channel Samson stated that his departure was caused by dispute with PTW owner - [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) over finances and overall poor talent treatment from Pawłowski's side. 

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Debut

Not long after his depature from PTW Samson joined Warsaw-based [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) federation as part of "Prime Time Transfers" deal made by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md). He made his debut at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) where he defeated Asara and [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) in a Triple Threat Match. He took part in another Three Way Match at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) where his victory was stolen from him by [Gustav's](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) personal trainer - [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md). His third match took place at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) where his opportunity to win UEWA Championship from [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) was cut short after his opponent hit a Low Blow on him. 

#### Feud with Gustav Gryffin

Frustrated over being denied a victory twice by various shenanigans Samson challenged Mister Z for a match at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md). He managed to win this fight and start rivalrly with Gustav Gryffin - [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md). They faced each other in a serie of three matches. First one at [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) was an Non-Title Match which ended via double count-out. They faced each other a month later at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) in a Anarchy Cyclone Tag-Team Match where Samson teamed up with [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) against Gustav and [Isnorr](@/w/insorr.md). Samson lost this match after being tied to the turnbuckle with leather straps by Gustav. This led to final match in trilogy at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md
) where he finally faced Gustav in a Strap Match with PpW Championship on the line. He was unable to win this fight, as he got submitted by champion. In a post-match interview he confessed that his self-esteem is seriously damaged, and that  he would need some time of from PpW.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

Samson made one-off apperance in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) where he faced [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) at [MZW No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) in October 2024.
