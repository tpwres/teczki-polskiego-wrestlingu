## Professional wrestling career

### Toruń Wrestling Federation (2011-2014)

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2017)

PJ Blake's career gained a lot more momentum in 2015, when he became one of the founders and core members of Toruń-based backyard federation [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md). He wrestled there from the very [first show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md) in June 2015 up until his last appearance at [Dream More And Never Stop](@/e/dfw/2017-12-09-dfw-dream-more-and-never-stop.md) in December 2017. Due to his heavyweight build, he won many of the matches in his career, but was never able to capture the [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md).

After DFW folded its operations, PJ Blake eventually retired from professional wrestling.
