## Professional wrestling career

### Attempts to become a wrestler

Young Istociarz was a backyard wrestler, active in his small project, [New Quality Wrestling](@/o/nqw.md), as LJ Blade. Per his own account, he took part in [Don Roid's](@/w/don-roid.md) original training camp, alongside [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) and [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md), and later [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md). This is corroborated by [MyWrestling article][antek-skomentuje] where a  mysterious "fourth man" is mentioned.

Painful training regimen and overall lack of organisation, however, discouraged him from further trainings under Roid. After that, Istociarz limited his activity on the wrestling scene to being a fan and to the Internet. He was active on forums like BillGoldbergZone and Ultimate Wrestling (as a moderator), and also worked as a newsman for WrestleFans - one of the most prominent Polish wrestling portals.

### Internet personality: Istota Wrestlingu (2023-present)

In 2023, he and his wife Martyna (also known as Istociara or Istotna Martynka) started a YouTube channel known as Istota Wrestlingu. The channel was initially niche, commenting on recent wrestling shows in Poland. They prided themselves on attending every single Polish event and quickly got acquainted with many of their viewers personally. The channel also started inviting various wrestlers for long, in-depth interviews.

They gradually moved from the pre-recorded audio-only podcast format towards live transmissions, adding video and creating their signature look by wearing cat-like lucha masks. The idea of masks, as per their official explanation, is to shift the focus away from the hosts and towards the content itself.
Along with moving to the live formula, their style also changed. Istociarz (then also known as Antek) gradually became more animated, coining his catchphrases such as _PASJA!_ ("passion", exclaimed in a specific way), _fuuuuuun_ and _Wake up! (to reality)_.

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2025-present)

After Martyna became an [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) trainee, the relationship between Istota Wrestlingu and [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) gradually started growing. The channel featured PpW angles (notably - [Gustav Gryffin ](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) [attacking][flecizm-stosowany] [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) during his interview, in a build-up to their match) and more PpW wrestlers (both live and in exclusive interviews). [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) called the channel biased and a "PpW's propaganda machine", rejecting an interview invitation (or alternatively, claiming he'd never heard of the channel and never received an invitation).

On January 24th, 2025, in an exclusive piece, MyWrestling confirmed that Istociarz would be added to the PpW commentary team. Joining [Joker](@/w/joker.md) and replacing Szymon "Modzel" Modzelewski, he debuted at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) and appeared at every show since. He also works on various aspects of the events, such as preshow direction, video production and conducting interviews with fans.
