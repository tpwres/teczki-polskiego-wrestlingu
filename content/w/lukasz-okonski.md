## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Debut

Starting with [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md), PTW moved from Chorzów to Kozłów and settled in a local [hotel/restaurant](@/v/dworek-kozlow.md) owned by Łukasz Okoński. He became increasingly involved in the product, first appearing in promo segments, then becoming PTW's co-owner and later the same year making his in-ring debut against Serg Sullivan. His appearance sparked some controversy, as he wore a BDSM-style mask and was led into the ring on a chain held by a scantly-clad woman, which seemd contrary to the promotion's intended family-friendly image.

#### Feud with Pawłowski

At [Underground 25](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md) Łukasz's business partner - [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) - got involved into a rivalry against current [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md) [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md). This was caused because of Puncher's attack on Okoński at [Underground 24](@/e/ptw/2024-11-16-ptw-underground-24.md) where the champion put Łukasz through the table. In a main event of Underground 25 Puncher was set to defend his championship against [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), but shockingly, Pawłowski turned heel and attakced Spartan with a chair, which caused a conflict between two owners. During the build-up before next show - [PTW: Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) - Łukasz was trying to reach to Pawłowski, but to no avail. They finally faced off at the show, where Pawłowski officialy turned not only on the fans, but also on his business partner by kicking him in the groin.
