## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2017-2019)

Adam debuted for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) at the [sixth Arena show](@/e/kpw/2017-04-08-kpw-arena-6-selekcja.md), and appeared in 12 matches,
both in singles and tag competition, and including several multi-man matches.
However he failed to win each one of them.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

After his KPW run, Bravo became affiliated with [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) and focused his social media channels on promoting the project.
Ultimately, he didn't make even a single official in-ring appearance for them.
His fellow KPW alumni [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) also shared the same fate - initially joining but never getting a match opportunity.
