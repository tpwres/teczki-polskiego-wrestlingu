## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut and "The Future of Polish Wrestling"

Dziedzic joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) after leaving [Mine City Wrestling](@/o/mcw.md), and made his debut at PTW's first show, [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he teamed up with Marius Al-Ani to defeat [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and former WWE superstar [Santino](@/w/santino.md). They managed to win the match, but afterwards the cocky personality of Dziedzic caused him to be left out and punished by Santino and PAKA in front of the audience. He adapted a villainous persona of "The Future of Polish Wrestling". He got involved in a feud with PAKA, where he alligned himself with other heels such as [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md). This led them to a Six-Man Tag Team Match at [BlackOut](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md) in which Dziedzic Team was defeated by the babyfaces. 

#### Losing streak 

Following his defeat at BlackOut, Dziedzic went into a long losing streak which lasted for over a year and a half. During that time he tried numerous things to gain any advantage which would allow him to score a victory. During his feud with [Samson](@/w/samson.md) he hired [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) as his mercenary to attack and injure his opponent during contract signing for their match at [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). Despite succesfully pulling Samson out of the card, Dziedzic was punished by [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), who attacked the cocky Dziedzic during the show. After Dziedzic and Longman lost their First Round Tag Team Match for the inaugural [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) Tournament, Wiktor finally turned on and abandoned his "client". 

#### Sinister Kingdom

Numerous failures led Dziedzic into adapting a more dark and desperate persona. At [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) he joined [Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md) - a villainous stable of Sinister and [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md). Joining Sinister Kingdom gave Dziedzic enough momentum to finally break his losing streak by defeating [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) at [Ryucon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md). At [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) Dziedzic was officially "baptised" as a member of Sinister Kingdom. The leadership of Sinister allowed him to get onto a winning streak and eventually join a Fatal Four Way Tag Team Match at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he - along with Sinister - faced PAKA, Budapest Bastards and MxM Collection. They were unsucessful in securing a win, but they stood tall, as - according to Sinister - they only cared about PAKA losing the Tag Team titles.

#### Total Blast and departure

At [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), Dziedzic and Krampus were involved in a surprise attack on Babathunder and Puncher in the main event of the show. Dziedzic an Krampus laid out both competitors, causing a no-contest ending. Standing tall alongside Krampus over the beaten-up Puncher and Babathunder, Dziedzic exclaimed "For his is the power, the kingdom and the glory, for ever" (Sinister's catchphrase, albeit slightly out of order), presumably challenging for the title on Sinister's behalf. The main event's finish was widely criticised by fans and never amounted to any storyline developments.

On May 31st 2024, Dziedzic appeared on the first episode of "No Gimmick Zone", a new YouTube show by Błażej "Blaze" Pniewski. Blaze, who had been a vocal supporter of PTW up to this point, expressed his disappointment with the Total Blast show, and slowly but surely turned against the project. Dziedzic openly appeared under his real name (Kacper Dziedzic), in a shoot-style interview. He discussed various backstage topics, from the creation of gimmicks to issues in PTW and the wider Polish scene. He supported the vision of Polish wrestling without boundaries, a phrase which PTW owner [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) coined but never truly committed to. This concept is about inter-promotional cooperation on the Polish scene. Dziedzic alleged that, even if Pawłowski disliked his remarks, he would stay loyal to PTW as that's where his heart was. He stated that he was going to attend PTW training on the upcoming Sunday, and face possible consequences. 

Three days later, on June 3rd, Dziedzic confirmed that he has been officially fired from Prime Time Wrestling, thus ending his time in the company.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-)

Four months after his release from PTW Dziedzic made his first in-ring appearance for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at their show [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md). He worked as a babyface and took part in a Triple Threat Match against [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) which he won, as well as in a Battle Royal later in the card, which was won by [Tony "The Riverman" Sheen](@/w/riverman.md). 

At MZW's [next show](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) Dziedzic answered Legia Łysych's open challenge, with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) as his tag team partner, however, they were unable to secure a victory over the experienced tag team. Later on he entered a contender tournament for a briefcase by facing villainous [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) at [Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md). He however lost by disqualification, when [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) attacked Aron with a chair. Despite that, he was still granted an opportunity for [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) against [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) at [Zjedz Mu Łeb](@/e/mzw/2025-09-27-mzw-zjedz-mu-leb.md), but he was unsucessful in that bout.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-)

#### Feud with Sinister

Dziedzic joined [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), a Katowice-based project funded by ex-PTW personalities, shortly after its inception. At [Legacy's first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) the guest host [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) added Dziedzic as an extra contender in [Chemik's](@/w/chemik.md) Open Challenge for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), declaring it a Triple Threat Match. During the fight Sinister unexpectedly prevented Dziedzic from breaking Chemik's pinfall attempt, which caused him to get into a conflict with his former master. At the [next show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) Dziedzic faced Sinister in a Singles Match which determined contendership for the upcoming Legacy Championship. Sinister refused to fight Dziedzic and vowed that Dziedzic would win that match no matter what. The old mentor of Syriusz tanked the whole match first by avoiding the fight, then by allowing Dziedzic to beat him without any defence, just to perform a "Judas kiss" and hit Dziedzic in the groin to cause a disqualification and allow Dziedzic to win.

### Shirts

Beginning with the [inaugural Legacy show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), Dziedzic has changed his former mostly-black ring gear to a mostly-white one, wearing (usually) sleeveless shirts with unique texts printed on them, mostly in red. They were:

* [Legacy of Wrestling](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) - **SOFT & PROUD**. A jab at [Istociarz](@/w/istociarz.md), for repeatedly claiming that Dziedzic is not "tough enough".
* [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) - **WŁOSY** (_HAIR_). When fighting [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), both of them bald.
* [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) - **NOBODY'S PUPPET**. A show of defiance against [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and his manipulations.
* [MZW Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md) - **R**. A nod to Team Rocket from the [Pokémon][kiepoty] series, of which his opponent in this match - [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) - is a fan.
* [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) - ~**SAJA BOYS**~. A reference to a villain boy band from the 2025 animated film [KPop Demon Hunters][kpop], likening [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) to the fictional group (underscored by his theme song for that show coming from that film).
* [MZW Zjedz Mu Łeb](@/e/mzw/2025-09-27-mzw-zjedz-mu-leb.md) - **Dziedzic wstawaj... wygrałeś** (_Dziedzic, get up... you've won_). A paraphrase of [Pan Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) words from [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) ("Syriusz, obudź się, wygrałeś" - _Syriusz, wake up, you've won_), said to Dziedzic after he was brutally beaten by [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md) and [Santino](@/w/santino.md) following his victory. The text on the shirt was accompanied by a silhouette of Dziedzic lying unconscious in the ring.
