## Professional wrestling career

### World Wrestling Entertainment (2012)

In April 2012 Santino Marella made his apperance at [WWE RAW House Show](@/e/wwe/2012-04-12-wwe-raw-house-show.md) which took place in ERGO Arena in Tri-City. It was one of few times when WWE hosted a live event in Poland.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

Santino made his return to polish soil after nearly a decade when he appeared at [Prime Time Wrestling's](@/o/ptw.md) first show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md). He alligned himself with [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) to be defeated by [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and Marius Al-Ani. 

He later made few other apperances, mostly to provide english live commentary along with Lewis Costello. Besides that, at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) it was announced that Santino will be a co-owner of PTW. Moments later he was attacked by [Bad Bones](@/w/bad-bones.md). It is confirmed that whole angle with co-ownership of PTW by canadian wrestler was a work, and due to lack of regular apperances of Santino afterwards the angle was eventually scrapped.

Santino made his last PTW's apperance at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he both made english commentary and a surprise entrance to Gold Rush Rumble for [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). He was eliminated by [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md)
