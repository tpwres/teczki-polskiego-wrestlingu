## Professional wrestling career

### World Wrestling Entertainment (2012)

#### WWE's live events

In April 2012 Santino Marella made his appearance at [WWE RAW House Show](@/e/wwe/2012-04-12-wwe-raw-house-show.md) which took place in the ERGO Arena in Tricity. It was one of the few times when WWE hosted a live event in Poland.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

Santino made his return to Polish soil after nearly a decade when he appeared at [Prime Time Wrestling's](@/o/ptw.md) first show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md). He aligned himself with [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) only to be defeated by [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and Marius Al-Ani.

He later made a few other appearances, mostly to provide live English commentary along with Lewis Costello. Besides that, at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) it was announced that Santino would co-own PTW. Moments later he was attacked by [Bad Bones](@/w/bad-bones.md). It was confirmed that the whole co-ownership angle was a work, and due to lack of regular appearances by Santino afterwards, the angle was eventually scrapped.

Santino made his last PTW appearance to date at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), where he both provided the English commentary and made a surprise entrance to the Gold Rush Rumble for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). He was eliminated by [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md).
