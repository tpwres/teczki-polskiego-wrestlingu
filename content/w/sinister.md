## Professional wrestling career

### Mine City Wrestling (2018-2019)

Sinister, back then known as David Sirch, made his debut in [Mine City Wrestling](@/o/mcw.md) at their [first show](@/e/mcw/2018-12-08-mcw-show-1.md). He made a total of three apperances there with the highlight of his tenure being a defeat in a Gauntlet Match against [Johny Vegas](@/w/johny-vegas.md) at [MCW Third Show](@/e/mcw/2019-09-14-mcw-show-3.md). 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut

Sinister made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at their first show - [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) - where he was one of the participants in Battle Royal Match, which was won by [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). He debuted as mysterious villain and the "puppet master". He quickly got involved in a first feud against babyface team called PAKA. He alligned himself with [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) in a short storyline serving as build-up for their Six-Man Tag Team Match at [PTW #2: Blackout](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md).

#### Feud with Nano Lopez

After Blackout Sinister jumped into the feud against one of the PTW's top babyfaces at the time - "Starboy" Nano Lopez. Their rivalisation started at [Underground 3](@/e/ptw/2022-03-27-ptw-underground-3.md) and continued for almost whole 2022. At [Ryucon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md) Sinister emerged victorious in a Submission Match after he used chloroform to put spanish wrestler to sleep. After that he started to test Nano Lopez willpower by setting up him in a unwinable matches. First, he made Starboy fight Pure Gold in a Handicap Match, later on he arranged a Gauntlet Match, where Nano Lopez had to win to secure his contract in PTW. He obviously lost said match by losing to Sinister himself. The supreme evil tore Nano's contract, eventually firing him from federation. After Nano got reinstated by [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) a show later they were scheduled for Last Man Standing Match at [PTW 3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). While the match was highly in Starboy's favour, he eventually got attacked by [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md), who alligned himself with Sinister to set up a foundation to Sinister's stable in PTW.

#### Sinister Kingdom

After Legends Sinister to make fewer apperances, limiting himself mostly to role of manager for Krampus. His persona was used as one of the main motives behind [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) which improved his position as a puppetmaster of the whole PTW. At the same show he added one more addition to his stable - Syriusz Dziedzic - who joined him to finally emerge his real self. He officialy "baptised" Dziedzic at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) and took part in Fatal Four Way Tag Team Match for [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where him and Dziedzic were more interesed in preventing PAKA from win, than actually winning by themselves possibly teasing new feud. 

Sinister Kingdom was not present during the build-up to PTW's sixth show - [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) - however, members of his stable were involved in a surprise attack on Babathunder and Puncher in a main event of said show. That booking decision was widely critisised by fans. Sinister and Dziedzic both [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) not long after, seemingly on bad terms with Arkadiusz Pawłowski.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024)

Sinister made his return to wrestling at [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) [first event](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). He was introduced as the jost of the show interrupting [Arkadiusz Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md), who kicked off the show. Later on he prevented his old subject Dziedzic from potential win in show's opener. He also got involved in restarting the main event, after [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) seemingly won [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) from [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) the referee decision got reverted by Sinister.
