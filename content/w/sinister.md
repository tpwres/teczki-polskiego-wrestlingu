## Professional wrestling career

### Mine City Wrestling (2018-2019)

Sinister, back then known as David Sirch, debuted in [Mine City Wrestling](@/o/mcw.md) at their [first show](@/e/mcw/2018-12-08-mcw-show-1.md). He made a total of three appearances there, with the highlight of his tenure being a defeat in a Gauntlet Match against [Johny Vegas](@/w/johny-vegas.md) at [MCW's third show](@/e/mcw/2019-09-14-mcw-show-3.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut

Sinister made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at their inaugural show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he was one of the participants in the Battle Royal Match, won by [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md).
He debuted as a mysterious villain and "puppet master". He quickly got involved in his first feud against the babyface team called PAKA. He aligned himself with [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) in a short storyline serving as a build-up for their Six-Man Tag Team Match at [PTW #2: Blackout](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md).

#### Feud with Nano Lopez

After [Blackout](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md), Sinister started a feud against one of the PTW's top babyfaces at the time - "Starboy" Nano Lopez. Their rivalry started at [Underground 3](@/e/ptw/2022-03-27-ptw-underground-3.md) and continued for almost the entire 2022. At [Ryucon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md) Sinister emerged victorious in a Submission Match, after he used chloroform to put the Spanish wrestler to sleep. After that he started to test Nano Lopez's willpower, by setting him up in unwinnable matches. First he made Starboy fight Pure Gold in a Handicap Match, later on he arranged a Gauntlet Match where Nano Lopez had to win to secure his contract in PTW. Lopez lost that match to Sinister himself. The Supreme Evil then tore Nano's contract, eventually firing him from the federation. After Nano got reinstated by [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) one show later, they were scheduled for a Last Man Standing Match at [PTW 3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). While the match was highly stacked in Starboy's favour, he eventually was attacked by [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md) who aligned himself with Sinister to set up a foundation to build his stable in PTW.

#### Sinister Kingdom

_Main article: [Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md)_

After [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) Sinister would make fewer in-ring appearances, limiting himself mostly to managing Krampus. His persona was used as one of the main motives behind [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) which improved his position as a puppet master of the whole PTW. At the same show, he added one more person to his stable - Syriusz Dziedzic - who joined him to finally emerge as his real self. Sinister officialy "baptised" Dziedzic at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) and took part in a Fatal Four Way Tag Team Match for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he and Dziedzic were more interested in preventing PAKA from winning than actually winning themselves, possibly teasing a new feud.
However, no action from Sinister Kingdom was required - with [Boro](@/w/boro.md) quietly leaving the promotion and Taras stretchered out after [Wiktor Longman's](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) attack at [Underground 20](@/e/ptw/2023-12-10-ptw-underground-20.md), [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) remained the last Paka member standing. At the same show, Sinister and Dziedzic celebrated Paka's demise in an over-the-top fashion, complete with party hats and party horns.

At [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), two members of Sinister Kingdom were involved in a surprise attack on Babathunder and Puncher in the main event of the show. Dziedzic an Krampus laid out both competitors, causing a no-contest ending. Standing tall alongside Krampus over the beaten-up Puncher and Babathunder, Dziedzic exclaimed "For his is the power, the kingdom and the glory, for ever" (Sinister's catchphrase, albeit slightly out of order), presumably challenging for the title on Sinister's behalf. The main event's finish was widely criticised by fans and never amounted to any storyline developments. Sinister and Dziedzic both [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) not long after, seemingly on bad terms with Arkadiusz Pawłowski.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

Sinister made his return to wrestling at [Legacy of Wrestling's](@/o/low.md) [first event](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). He was introduced as the show's host, interrupting [Arkadiusz Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md), who kicked off the event. Later on he prevented his old subject Dziedzic from scoring a win in the show's opener. He also got involved in restarting the main event - after [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) seemingly won the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) from [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), the referee decision got reverted by Sinister who pointed out that Fox's winning pin should have been interrupted due to a rope break.

#### Feud with Dziedzic

At the [next Legacy's show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) Dziedzic faced Sinister in a Singles Match which determined contendership for the upcoming Legacy Championship. Sinister refused to fight Dziedzic and vowed that Dziedzic would win that match no matter what. The old mentor of Syriusz tanked the whole match first by avoiding the fight, then by allowing Dziedzic to beat him without any defence, just to perform a "Judas kiss" and hit Dziedzic in the groin to cause a disqualification and allow Dziedzic to win. At the [third show](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) he once again tried to torment Dziedzic by interfering in his Six-Man Tag Team Match and handing him a weapon, but Dziedzic declined his offer, which resulted in him being defeated by his opponents.
