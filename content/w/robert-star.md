## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Robert Star debuted at [DDW#8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) in a tag team match against Hungarian wrestlers [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md) and [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), while his tag team partner was [Dover](@/w/dover.md), also Hungarian. Prior to his debut, Robert trained at [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md)'s wrestling school.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

#### Debut 

At the end of 2014, DDW moved its operations to Gdańsk. This did not last long, as by 2015 Roid retired from wrestling and sold the ring to a team of his wrestlers from the area. This team became [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), and one of these people was Robert, who later main-evented many of their shows. In KPW, he adopted a rockstar persona, nicknamed "The Polish Stallion", wearing leather, jeans and sunglasses to the ring, and using Steel Panther's "Party All Day" as his entrance song.

#### Feud with Piękny Kawaler 

In 2018, Robert became the leader of an all-faces faction in KPW called "Sojusz", which feuded with all-heels faction Kawaleria (_Cavalry_), led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md).
These events played out at [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md) and [Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md).
On the following show [Godzina Zero 2018](@/e/kpw/2018-08-11-kpw-godzina-zero-2018.md), Robert was forced to join Kawaleria, wear their signature facepaint, and come to ringside with its members. As time went on, he became increasingly uncomfortable with his position.
He was part of a tag team with Piękny Kawaler, and entered the Tag Team Tournament at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md). However, the two of them were disqualified, due to Kawaler being under the influence.
This storyline was resolved on [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md): after Robert defeated Ron Corvus to become [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md), Kawaler appeared and requested that Robert hand over the belt to him. He revealed that Robert has signed a contract with him and Kawaleria, and that he was helping Robert win the title on the condition he immediately handed it over to Kawaler.
Before the [following show](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14-nastepny-poziom.md), Robert was officially fired, in a Facebook post, for breaking the terms of said contract. This stripped him of the championship, and left it vacant. However, on the show, Chairman Malinowski re-added Robert to the main event, which was now a 6-man elimination match. Robert managed to win said match and regain his KPW Championship.

#### KPW Champion and departure

Robert's next match for KPW was at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), against Piękny Kawaler. This bout was both for the KPW Championship, and for the career of both men, with a Last Man Standing stipulation. When Robert defeated Kawaler, the latter initially accepted his opponent's handshake, lifted Robert's arm in a victory pose, only to land a surprise kick seconds later. With the help of other babyfaces, Robert regained control, and together they struck a victory pose with Kawaler literally under Robert's heel. 

Robert's last apperance in KPW took place at [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md) where he protected [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) from [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) who attacked his tag team partner after a defeat. Following that show Robert left the federation, eventually vacating KPW Championship.

In 2018, Robert competed in his first match abroad: at French Ligue Nationale de Catch's event in Commercy. He went against French wrestler Scott Rider in a singles match, and also against a team including Scott Rider and Ron Corvus in an eight-man tag team match.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2023)

Almost immediately after KPW Arena 16 event, Polish authorities introduced severe lockdown in response to COVID, and KPW went on hiatus until August 2021. In the meantime, a new promotion appeared in the country: [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), and started scouting for talent. Both Robert and Sawicki joined PTW, but only Robert would go inside the ropes there.

In October 2021, Robert made his debut for Prime Time Wrestling at their [first show](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), losing to ex-WWE wrestler Chris Masters. Throughout 2022 and 2023, he appeared at most of their major shows, and a couple of times at the smaller monthly Underground shows. He mainly feuded with [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), which lasted from [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) in November 2022 up until his last appearance for PTW at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) in June 2023. In this match, Robert defended his Dansk Pro Wrestling championship, which he held since March that year.

In December 2023, Robert's Facebook page posted a graphic saying "BYE BYE", which the fans read as him being dropped from PTW. This was later confirmed by the organization removing him from their roster page.

In January 2021 Robert was slated to debut for Danish BODYSLAM! Pro-Wrestling's event, against Carlos Zamora. This did not pan out, as the event was cancelled due to COVID restrictions. The debut was postponed till in May 2021, when he defeated Danish wrestler Hype Boy. Since then, he regularly appeared at Dansk Pro Wrestling and BODYSLAM!'s events, and occasionally for other Danish and Nordic promotions. In 2023, Robert started tagging with [Hunyadi Tamas](@/w/hunyadi-tamas.md), and won the BODYSLAM! tag team titles, in addition to continuing his run as champion for DPW. He also made appearances in Scotland and Germany.

### PpW Ewenement (2024)

On May 11th, 2024, [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) announced booking Robert Star for [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) next month.
This surprised fans, but was well received, both by fans and wrestling YouTubers. PpW's wrestlers re-posted this to their Instagram stories, with comments like "One Polish Stallion, worth more than 1200 horsepower" (referring to the [PTW Lottery](@/o/ptw.md#the-lottery)). The date was by no means accidental, as PTW's event [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) was held that day.
Robert faced another wrestler who made "Prime Time Transfer" - [Samson](@/w/samson.md) - for UEWA Championship. During the match Robert turned heel after getting himself disqualified to not lose the match.
