## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Robert Star debuted at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) in a tag team match with a Hungarian wrestler [Dover](@/w/dover.md) against [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md) and [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), also Hungarians. Prior to his debut, Robert trained at [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md)'s wrestling school.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

#### Debut

At the end of 2014 DDW moved their operations to Gdańsk. This did not last long, as by 2015 Roid retired from wrestling and sold the ring to a team of his wrestlers from the area. This team became [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), and one of these people was Robert, who later main-evented many of their shows. He adopted a rockstar persona nicknamed "The Polish Stallion", wearing leather, jeans and sunglasses to the ring, and using Steel Panther's "Party All Day" as his entrance song.

#### Feud with Piękny Kawaler

In 2018 Robert became the leader of an all-babyface faction called "Sojusz" (_The Alliance_), which feuded with an all-heels faction "Kawaleria" (_The Cavalry_), led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md).
These events played out at [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9.md) and [Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md).
At the following show, [Godzina Zero 2018](@/e/kpw/2018-08-11-kpw-godzina-zero-2018.md), Robert was forced to join Kawaleria, wear their signature facepaint, and come to ringside with other members. As time went on, he became increasingly uncomfortable with his position.
He was part of a tag team with Piękny Kawaler and entered the Tag Team Tournament at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md). However, the two of them were disqualified, due to Kawaler being under the influence.
This storyline was resolved at [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md): after Robert defeated Ron Corvus to become the [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md), Kawaler appeared and requested that Robert hand over the belt to him. He revealed that Robert has signed a contract with him and Kawaleria, and that he was helping Robert win the title on the condition he immediately handed it over to Kawaler.
Before the [following show](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md), Robert was officially fired via a Facebook post for breaking the terms of said contract.
This stripped him of the championship, which was left vacant. However, at the show, [Chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) added Robert to the main event, which was now a six-man elimination match. Robert managed to win said match and regain his KPW Championship.

#### KPW Champion and departure

Robert's next match for KPW was at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), against Piękny Kawaler. This bout was both for the KPW Championship, and for the careers of both men, with a Last Man Standing stipulation. When Robert defeated Kawaler, the latter initially accepted his opponent's handshake and lifted Robert's arm in a victory pose, only to land a surprise kick seconds later. With the help of other babyfaces, Robert regained control and together they struck a victory pose with Kawaler literally under Robert's heel.

Robert's last appearance in KPW took place at [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md) where he protected [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) from [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), who attacked his tag team partner after their defeat. Following that show Robert left the federation, vacating the KPW Championship.

In 2018 Robert competed in his first match abroad: at the French Ligue Nationale de Catch's event in Commercy. He went against the French wrestler Scott Rider in a singles match, and also against a team including Scott Rider and Ron Corvus in an eight-man tag team match.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2023)

Almost immediately after KPW Arena 16, Polish authorities introduced severe lockdown in response to COVID-19, and KPW went on a hiatus until August 2021. In the meantime, a new promotion appeared in the country: [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), and started scouting for talent. Both Robert and Sawicki joined PTW, but only Robert would make in-ring appearance there.

In October 2021, Robert made his debut for Prime Time Wrestling at their [first show](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), losing to the ex-WWE wrestler Chris Masters. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Star appeared at most of their major shows, and a couple of times at the smaller monthly Underground shows. He mainly feuded with [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), which lasted from [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) in November 2022 up until his last appearance for PTW at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) in June 2023. In this match, Robert defended his Dansk Pro Wrestling championship, which he held since March of that year.

In December 2023, Robert's Facebook page posted a graphic saying "BYE BYE", which the fans understood as him being dropped from PTW. This was later confirmed by the organization removing him from their roster page.

In January 2021 Robert was slated to debut at a Danish BODYSLAM! Pro-Wrestling's event against Carlos Zamora. This did not pan out, as the event was cancelled due to the COVID restrictions. The debut was postponed util May 2021, when Star defeated Danish wrestler Hype Boy. Since then, he regularly appeared at Dansk Pro Wrestling and BODYSLAM!'s events, and occasionally for other Danish and Nordic promotions. In 2023, Robert started tagging with [Hunyadi Tamas](@/w/hunyadi-tamas.md) and won the BODYSLAM! tag team title, in addition to continuing his run as champion for DPW. He also made appearances in Scotland and Germany.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Early appearances

On May 11th, 2024, [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) announced booking Robert Star for [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) the following month.
This surprised fans, but was well received both by fans and wrestling YouTubers. PpW wrestlers shared this to their Instagram stories, with comments like "One Polish Stallion, worth more than 1200 horsepower" (referring to the [PTW Lottery](@/o/ptw.md#the-lottery) and its main prize, a 1200HP Nissan GTR). The date was by no means accidental, as PTW's event [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) was held on that day.

Robert faced another "Prime Time Transfer" - [Samson](@/w/samson.md) - for the UEWA Championship. During the match Robert turned heel after getting himself disqualified so as not to lose the match. 

#### Championship pursuit and joining Rodzina

In 2025 Robert returned once more during the 20 Typa 20 Broni Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md). 
At [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) he managed to win the Six-Man #1 Contender Ladder Match for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md). The match was set up to take place at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md), however before it took place, Star intervened in a Tornado Tag Team Match between [Rodzina](@/tt/rodzina.md) members ([Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) & [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md)) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) & [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). He helped Oskar and Agatka win, revealing himself as the newest member of Rodzina which was teased by the faction leader, [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), during the build-up to the show.

Robert himself was unable to win his match against the defending champion [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), even though Rodzina once again tried to help their fellow member to gain advantage.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025)

Robert was announced as a special guest for [Legacy's](@/o/low.md) [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md). He observed the first few matches sitting at the bar, close to the ring. In the fourth match, [Greg](@/w/greg.md) was scheduled to face [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), but [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) jumped Greg during his entrance routine. When Acting Chairman [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) forced Chemik to return to the backstage, Robert came out, in full ring gear and helped Greg, by attacking Chemik. The singles match was quickly turned into a Tag Team Match, where Robert joined his longtime KPW rival Greg against Chemik and Vic.

## International wrestling appearances

Robert Star made his first confirmed wrestling appearance outside of Poland in 2018, when he worked for French federation League Nationale de Catch. From 2021 onwards Robert moved to Denmark and started taking regular bookings across the Europe, most notably in Denmark, Scotland, Austria and Germany. 

During his career he became the BODYSLAM Tag Team Champion (with [Hunyadi Tamas](@/w/hunyadi-tamas.md) and Phoenix Fonden), as well as DPW Worlds Champion and European Heavyweight Champion.
