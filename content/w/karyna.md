## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-2024)

Karyna made her debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md), where she portrayed a [Olgierd's](@/w/olgierd.md) girlfriend and valet. Her gimmick, and also the characteristic ringname, was heavily inspired by the stereotypical Polish chavette. In total she made seven appearances as the valet for Legia Łysych, a villainous Tag Team of Olgierd and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md). Her last public appearance took place at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where Legia Łysych gave her an ultimatum: either she shaves her head bald, or she is out of the team. She didn't answer Olgierd's call, which resulted in her being dumped by the bald tag team. Later on she appeared during the Gold Rush Rumble Match, where she came up to the eliminated Olgierd and slapped him, thus officially ending their on-screen relationship. After that appearance she seemingly retired from wrestling.
