## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2020)

#### Debut and first run

Justin Joy made his debut in a wrestling ring in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) after being trained in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) academy. Along with [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) and [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) he was one of the first members of the roster in the Głuchołazy-based federation. He quickly became one of most prominent members of the roster working mostly as a villainous pretty boy. His popularity resulted in him being crowned the inaugural [MZW Champion](@/c/mzw-championship.md, after he defeated [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) at [Champions War II](@/e/mzw/2016-01-10-mzw-champions-war-2.md) in January 2016. His reign lasted until May of the same year, when he lost the title to Shadow in a Loser Leaves MZW Match.

#### Return and second run

After his defeat in a match against Shadow, Justin Joy went on a hiatus and emigrated to UK to train wrestling there, gaining more experience. He made his return at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) in December 2017 and remained in the federation as a worker, coach and - since 2018 - a member of the booking team. During his second stint in MZW he was one of the most popular wrestlers, working mainly as a fan-favourite. He won the [MZW Tag Team Championship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) alongside [Apollo Anderson](@/w/apollo-anderson.md) as WATAHA, but after a disagreement between them, and Apollo's heel turn, they were stripped of the title.
Later on, Justin also fought against [Damien Rothschild](@/w/damien-rothschild.md) for the MZW Championship at [Project 5: Hero](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md), but was unable to score a victory. His last match took place at [MZW Project 7: Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md) where he was defeated by [Zeritus](@/w/zeritus.md) and appeared to turn heel by joining [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) and [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md), but due to his departure from MZW this angle was cut short.

During his time in MZW Joy was also one of the main coaches in MZW's school, [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md). A huge portion of the wrestlers trained under him in 2018-2019 formed an informal group called ["Zieloni"](@/a/zieloni.md), with Justin Joy being credited as one of them.

## First retirement and Ninja Warrior Poland (2020-2022)

Using his real name Oskar Haracz, Justin Joy entered Ninja Warrior Poland, a sports reality show where contestants face a difficult obstacle course. Starting in season 3, he entered the elimination round but failed to complete the course. Later in season 6, he was one of the finalists and completed the first final stage. In 2023 he also entered the 8th edition, but failed to qualify.

## Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2023)

Justin was one of the MZW wrestlers who chose to join the new [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), debuting at [PTW Underground 3](@/e/ptw/2022-03-27-ptw-underground-3.md). He had a heated feud with his protégé [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), which culminated with the two clashing in a No Disqualification Match at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). After the match - which was won by Justin - two real-life friends mended fences and joined forces to take part in the inaugural [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament, with Justin reverting back to his babyface persona. His rivalry with Axel Fox allowed him to win multiple [PTW Awards](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md) at the end of 2022.

Later in 2023, when PTW held [a show in Wrocław](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), Justin's usual turf, he was nowhere on the card. In the build-up to the next major show, various wrestlers - including Justin - started to voice their frustration with PTW's owner and GM [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) on social media. This resulted in many of them getting silently removed from the organization's roster.

Justin organized a Q&A on his Instagram profile and posted a number of instastories, answering fans' questions and explaining his departure and sour relations with the organization.

Since then, he had no wrestling matches, preferring to focus on his activities as a fitness trainer, sports influencer and returning to Ninja Warrior once more.
