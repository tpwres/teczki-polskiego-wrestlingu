## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2012-present)

#### Backyard era

Michael HT started his career in wrestling back in 2012, working as "Jeff", actively taking part in numerous backyard matches against his colleagues from [PpW](@/o/ppw.md).
During that time he also served as a part-time referee. Not much is known about those days, but it is certain that during this time Jeff won the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) (in its backyard version) at least once, before losing it to [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) at [PpW Neomania III](@/e/ppw/2013-07-12-ppw-neomania-iii.md).
Around 2014 he retired from in-ring activities, but stayed with PpW and its crew up until the professional era.

#### Professional era

After PpW began to host more professional shows open for the general public, it was clear that the organization needed permanent host and ring announcer.
Michael HT took on this role, and quickly became the main host of nearly every Ppw event since [PpW Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) in June 2021.
Besides that he also made numerous appearances in various PpW shows and highlight videos as a host or interviewer.

During [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) he made a surprise one-off appearance as wrestler, when he took part in the Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match, but was quickly defeated.
