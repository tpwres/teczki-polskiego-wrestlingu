## Professional wrestling career

### Pomerania Indy Wrestling Group (2009)

Asmund made his in-ring debut working for a backyard federation ran by [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) - then known as The Seraphim - called [Pomerania Indy Wrestling Group](@/o/piwg.md). Not much is known about that time due to lack of sources. It is known, however, that Asmund (then as Rider, a character inspired by motorcycle gang members) made at least one appearance there at [Episode 2](@/e/piwg/2009-04-25-piwg-s01e02.md) in early 2009. After a short stint in PIWG, Rider left the federation to begin his professional training.

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2010-2011)

After leaving PIWG Rider joined his colleague Kamil Aleksander in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), where he started professional training under the supervision of [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) and [Joe Legend](@/w/joe-legend.md). He made his debut in May 2010 in a Ten-Man Gauntlet Match for the [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) at [All Or Nothing](@/e/ddw/2010-05-08-ddw-all-or-nothing.md). Besides that he worked two more matches at another show, [Dzień Sądu](@/e/ddw/2011-01-15-ddw-5-dzien-sadu.md). He made no more appearances in DDW, and left the promotion some time later.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2019)

In January 2015, after a four-year hiatus, Rider - now known as Asmund - made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), a Głuchołazy-based federation operated by his ex-DDW colleagues [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md). His debut took place during [Charity Event](@/e/mzw/2015-01-11-mzw-charity-show-2015.md), where he was defeated by Jędruś.

For most of 2015 and 2016 Asmund worked as a midcard tweener talent, portraying a Viking warrior persona. During that time he also made a one-off appearance at [Lucha Show](@/e/mzw/2016-09-10-mzw-lucha-show.md) as masked luchador "El Diamante". At [Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md) Asmund defeated Shadow in a Hardcore Match for the [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). His reign lasted 225 days, until Shadow reclaimed it in a Triple Threat Match at [Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md).

During the "Project Era" Asmund became one of the top stars on the roster, managing to score a decent victory streak. At [Project 5: Hero](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md) he defeated [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) winning the #1 Contender Spot for the MZW Championship. He faced [Damien Rothschild](@/w/damian-lambert.md) - who managed to defeat Shadow and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) beforehand - at [Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) in August 2019. Asmund defeated Rothschild, winning the MZW Championship for the second time in his career, but immedietaly after his victory he cut a promo in which he announced his retirement from professional wrestling. This marked Asmund's final appearance on the Polish wrestling scene.

## International wrestling appearances

Between 2017 and 2019 Asmund made a few appearances for Hungarian Pro Wrestling Magyarország and Germany-based Next Step Wrestling.
