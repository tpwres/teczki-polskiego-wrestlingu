## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

Gabriel Queen started his pro wrestling career as Nathan Cross, at the MZW academy, training under [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) and [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md).
He made his debut in a Rookie Battle Royal at [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), ending runner-up to eventual winner [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md).
His singles match debut was a couple months later, at [MZW Project 7: Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md), where he was defeated by [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md).
During that time, he also became the one of founding members of "[The Greens](@/a/the-greens.md)".
He also made appearances at MZW's taped shows during the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of episodes titled [MZW Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md), where he was managed by [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md).
After making his final appearance at [MZW Project Basement 4](@/e/mzw/2021-06-11-mzw-project-basement-4.md), he left the company.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2023)

Shortly after leaving MZW, Gabriel Queen joined the newly created [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), making his debut as a joker entrant in a battle royal during [PTW #1 REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he was the first one to be eliminated.
He then continued his career in PTW, becoming one of the workhorses of the federation, with a long-lasting streak of appearances on every PTW show.

#### Pure Gold and championship pursuit

After [Vic Golden's](@/w/vic-golden.md) debut in PTW, they quickly formed a tag team called Pure Gold.
As the main and most popular heel faction during that time, they feuded with PAKA ([Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), [Boro](@/w/boro.md) & [Taras](@/w/taras.md)) from June 2022 until June 2023 and [PTW 4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) show, where they main-evented in a tables match for the PTW Tag Team Championship, which PAKA won.

#### Feud with Legia Łysych

Shortly after that loss Vic Golden suffered an injury, and was sidelined for a couple of months, ultimately never making his PTW return.
Over that time Gabriel Queen aligned for a short while with Legia Łysych ([Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and Karyna), but the alliance was quickly turned into a feud, which resulted in a loss against Olgierd in a [Street Fight](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md), and a victory against Marco Hammers at [PTW Underground 18](@/e/ptw/2023-10-01-ptw-underground-18.md).
That show marks his last appearance in the PTW ring.

In those months he also started taking bookings from abroad, making appearances in Austria, Germany and Denmark.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-)

#### Debut and feud with Zmowa

Gabriel Queen made his debut for [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), where he faced [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md).
After securing victory, he was attacked by his defeated opponent, however his tag team partner - [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - made his surprise debut by saving him from the beatdown.

The reunited tag team issued an open challenge at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), which was surprisingly accepted by Legia Łysych, at that time still associated with PTW. The two teams reignited their feud from PTW, delivering a well-received match.
Their rivalry with Legia Łysych - especially [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - continued, and Gabriel faced him at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) in a No Weapons Hooligan Street Fight, which ended in Olgierd's disqualification for using a weapon.
This led to Gabriel and Vic going against the villainous stable [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md) in an Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), which they won as part of a coalition against Zmowa, led by [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md).

#### Championship pursuit

At [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz z Krzesłami](@/e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md) in December 2024 Gabriel won a Gauntlet Match, which resulted in Biesiad - dressed as Santa Biesiad - gifting him a contract to face the [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md).
Later that night, Gabriel attacked Gustav after his match with [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), and introduced his gloved thumb into Gustav's rectum. The humiliated champion accepted the fact that he would have to face Gabriel at Gruba Przesada. At that show, just before the match started, he stipulated a 15 minute time limit, stating that he values his time. Due to a referee knock-out, Queen was unable to win the Championship.

At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) Pure Gold teamed up against Gustav and Isnorr. The match resulted in Gustav and Isnorr's defeat, after Vic Golden pinned Isnorr. Nevertheless, it was Gustav's first defeat during his title reign, and Gabriel challenged Gustav for a rematch at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md). The match was set up in a Two Out Of Three Falls stipulation, and during the match, just before Gabriel Queen went for the second pinfall and victory, he was struck with a chair by long-time friend Vic Golden, which allowed Gustav to defeat Gabriel and end their feud.
