## Professional wrestling career

### 2018-2021 MZW

Gabriel Queen started his pro wrestling career, as Nathan Cross, at the MZW academy, training under Justin Joy, Asmund and Shadow.
He made his debut in a Rookie Battle Royal at [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), ending runner-up to eventual winner [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md).
He made his singles match debut at [MZW Project 7: Golden Road](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md), where he was defeated by [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md).
During that time he also became the one of founding members of "[The Greens](@/a/the-greens.md)".
He also made appearances at MZW's taped shows during the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of episodes titled [MZW Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md), where he was managed by [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md).
After making his final apperance at [MZW Project Basement 4](@/e/mzw/2021-06-11-mzw-project-basement-4.md), he left the company.

### 2021-2023 PTW

Shortly after leaving MZW, Gabriel Queen joined the newly created [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), making his debut as a joker entrant in a battle royal during [PTW#1 REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he was the first one to be eliminated.
He then continued his career in PTW, becoming one of the workhorses of the federeation, with a long-lasting streak of appearances on every PTW show.

After [Vic Golden's](@/w/vic-golden.md) debut in PTW, they quickly formed a tag team called Pure Gold.
As the main and most popular heel faction during that time, they feuded with PAKA ([Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), [Boro](@/w/boro.md) & [Taras](@/w/taras.md)) from June 2022 until June 2023 and [PTW 4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) show, where they main-evented in a tables match for the PTW Tag Team Championship, which PAKA won.


Not long after that loss Vic Golden suffered a injury, and was sidelined for couple of months, ultimately never making his PTW return.
During that time Gabriel Queen aligned for a short while with Legia Łysych ([Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and Karyna), but the alliance was quickly turned into a feud, which resulted in a loss against Olgierd in a [Street Fight](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md), and a victory against Marco Hammers at [PTW Underground 18](@/e/ptw/2023-10-01-ptw-underground-18.md).
That show marks his last appearance in the PTW ring.
During that time he also started taking bookings from abroad, making appearances in Austria, Germany and Denmark.

### 2024 PpW

Gabriel Queen made his debut for [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), where he faced [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md).
After securing victory, he was attacked by his defeated opponent, however his tag team partner - [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - made his surprise debut by saving him from a beatdown.
The reunited tag team issued an open challange at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), which was surprisingly accepted by Legia Łysych, at that time still associated with PTW. The two teams reignited their feud from PTW, delivering a well-received match.
