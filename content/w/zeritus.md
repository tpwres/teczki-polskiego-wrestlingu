## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016-2023)

#### Irregural appearances

Zeritus made a few appearances in Maniac Zone Wrestling. Two of them took place in 2016, when he teamed up with [Hexia](@/w/hexia.md) as part of a monster-heel tag team at [Champions War II](@/e/mzw/2016-01-10-mzw-champions-war-2.md) and [Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md). He then returned in 2019/2020, performing at three MZW shows: Projects [5](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md), [6](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) and [7](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md).
After the COVID-19 pandemic he returned once more for [MZW Game ON](@/e/mzw/2023-03-11-mzw-game-on.md).

Zeritus was able to perform for MZW mostly due to friendly relations between MZW and Dresden-based German federations such as Next Step Wrestling.
Besides his ventures in Poland, Zeritus is mostly known for his appearances in German and other Central-European federations, such as wXw, TAW, Passion Pro and others.
