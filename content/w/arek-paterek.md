His on-air debut took place at PTW's debut show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md). He provided commentary for most PTW shows, covering a total of nineteen events. Paterek's final appearance was at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), after which he announced his [departure from PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)
