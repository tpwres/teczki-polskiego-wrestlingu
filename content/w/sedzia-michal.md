## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2019-2021)

Sędzia Michał started his pro wrestling training at [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md) - [MZW's](@/o/mzw.md) wrestling school - in 2018. He initially aimed to be a wrestler, however he quickly switched to a referee role. He made his debut at [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) where he worked alongside [Referee Tobias](@/w/sedzia-tobias.md). He also made his appearances during MZW's taped show [Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md) where he was joined by [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md). After the lockdown he made yet another appearance at [MZW Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md), which turned out to be his last.

When MZW's schedule became more and more irregular, Sędzia Michał had left the federation and retired from his referee duties.
