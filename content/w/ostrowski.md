## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Boski started his wrestling career in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) where he was trained by [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md), [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md). He made his debut in August 2014 at [DDW Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/ddw/2014-08-16-ddw-pokaz-adeptow.md), where he worked as "El Homo" - playing a jobber-luchador role whose ringname strongly suggested his sexual orientation. In his debut match he was defeated by [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md).

Ostrowski made his next official appearance at [DDW House Show](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md) in March 2015, this time under his unmasked alias - Boski Ostrowski. He adapted the babyface persona of a flamboyant dancer, which he maintained and later developed throughout his career. He was unable to score any victories, as he was defeated both in his Singles Match against [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and in a Rookie Battle Royal later that night. He made an appearance at the last DDW show at [Baltikon](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2020)

#### Debut

After DDW folded their operations, Boski immediately joined [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), DDW's successor organization. At the KPW first show, [KPW vs the World: Hung(a)ry for Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), he teamed up with [Victor Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) against the members of Kawaleria - [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) and [GREG](@/w/greg.md). After that, Ostrowski started making regular appearances at KPW shows, posing as a babyface accompanied by his manager - and a part-time tag team partner - [Mira](@/w/mira.md). At the first few [Arena][arena-1] events, he managed to score a few victories against rivals such as [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md), Victor Rosetti and Luxus.

#### Teaming with Oliwa

At [Godzina Zero 2016][gz16] Ostrowski allied himself with [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) to compete against Luxus and GREG - this time he was defeated, after GREG pinned Oliwa. They managed to get back on track after their Tag Team victory over [Mateusz Kowalski](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md) and Rosetti at [KPW Arena 4][arena-4]. Boski and Oliwa teamed up rather regularly up until they lost to Kawaleria at [Szlamfest](@/e/kpw/2017-02-04-kpw-szlamfest.md) in February 2017.

#### Championships pursuits

Shortly after, at [KPW Arena 6][arena-6], Ostrowski managed to earn an opportunity to challenge Piękny Kawaler for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md). The match took place at [Arena 7][arena-7], but Ostrowski was unable to defeat the leader of Kawaleria.
After his defeat, Ostrowski managed to stay relevant in championship pursuits. He was one of the contenders in both the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match at [Godzina Zero 2017][gz17], and in a #1 Contender Match for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md).

#### Sojusz

During the build-up for [KPW Arena 9][arena-9], Boski Ostrowski - along with Mira - was convinced by [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) to join "Sojusz" (_The Alliance_), an impromptu alliance of babyfaces against the villainous Kawaleria. At said show he allied himself with another Sojusz member, [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), to face Mateusz Kowalski & [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md), as well as Rosetti, who was left without a tag team partner. At [Arena X][arena-x] Ostrowski was defeated by the debuting powerhouse [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md). At [OldTown 3](@/e/kpw/2018-07-14-kpw-oldtown-3.md) he fought as part of Sojusz, in a Six-Man Tag Team Match against Kawaleria, which the babyfaces lost.

#### Reunion and programme with David Oliwa

After the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament was announced, Ostrowski quickly allied himself with his old teammate David Oliwa. At [KPW Arena 11][arena-11], as "Boska Oliwa", they managed to advance to the finals of the tournament, defeating the team of [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) & Greg, and the British Bouncer Club, making it to the finals where they lost to [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and Rosetti.
This marked the first major crack in their relationship, which was further developed when they were set up for a match at [KPW Arena 12][arena-12] with a KPW OldTown Championship #1 Contender spot at stakes. Oliwa defeated his tag team partner, which caused Ostrowski to turn on him after the match. At the [next show][arena-13] Ostrowski tried to challenge David for a match, but was booked against [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md). He managed to emerge victorious in that match, and even got into a physical altercation with Oliwa.

At [Godzina Zero 2019][gz19] Ostrowski managed to win the Magnificent Seven Elimination Ladder Match, which allowed him to face his ex-friend Oliwa once more for the KPW OldTown Championship. Along with a change in his persona, he dropped his disco dancing persona, adopting a new, darker and edgier look with a new ringname - Boski 2.0 - which supposedly marked a new chapter in his career. [Chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) decided to add one more opponent to the planned match - Greg - met with a negative reaction by Boski. At [KPW Arena 15][arena-15] the scheduled match took place, but Boski was again unable to defeat his rival. At [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie][arena-16] Boski 2.0 demanded a rematch against Oliwa, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a long hiatus between Arena 16 and the [next show][arena-17], these plans were scrapped. Ostrowski ultimately left KPW sometime between 2020 and 2021.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

Boski 2.0, along with numerous other ex-KPW wrestlers, joined a new federation created in the Silesia region by [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md): [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). However, just like the numerous other "Blues" (other KPW talent who joined the new organization), his participation was restricted to promoting the federation on his social media, never securing any bookings.
