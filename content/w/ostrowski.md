At said show he alligned himself with another Sojusz member: [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), to face Mateusz Kowalski & [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md), as well as Rosetti, who was left without a tag team partner.

#### Reunion and programme with David Oliwa

After [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament was announced Ostrowski quickly alligned himself with his old teammate - David Oliwa. At [KPW Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md) they managed to advance to the finals of said tournament - defeating teams of [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) & Greg, and British Bouncer Club. They were however defeated by [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and Rosetti in a final. This marked the first major crack in their relationship, which was further developed when they were set up for a match at [KPW Arena 12](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12-gwiazda-polnocy.md) with KPW OldTown Championship #1 Contender spot as a stake. Oliwa defeated his tag team partner, which caused Boski Ostrowski to turn on him after the match. At the [next show](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md) Ostrowski tried to challenge David for a match, but got booked against [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md). He managed to emerge victorious in said match, and even got into the physical altercation with Oliwa.

At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) he managed to won Magnificent Seven Elimination Ladder Match, which allowed him to face his ex-friend Oliwa for KPW OldTown Championship. Along with change in his persona, he also adopted new ringname - Boski 2.0 - which supposedly marked a new chapter in his career. [Chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) decided to add one more opponent to planned match - Greg - which was negatively recepted by Boski 2.0. At [KPW Arena 15](@/e/kpw/2019-11-16-kpw-arena-15-swieza-krew.md) scheduled match took place, but Boski 2.0 was again unable to defeat his rival. At [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md) Boski 2.0 demanded a rematch against Oliwa, but due to COVID pandemic and long KPW hiatus between Arena 16 and the next show this plans were scrapped.

Due to pandemic pro wrestling hiatus, which also affected KPW, all of the scheduled plans were scrapped. Boski 2.0 ultimately left KPW sometime between 2020 and 2021. 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

Boski 2.0, along with numerous other ex-KPW wrestlers joined federation created in Silesia region by [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md): [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).
