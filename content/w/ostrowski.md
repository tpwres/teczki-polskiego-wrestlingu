## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Boski started his wrestling career in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) where he was trained by [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md), [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md). He made his debut in August 2014 at [DDW Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/ddw/2014-08-16-ddw-pokaz-adeptow.md), where he worked under "El Homo" gimmick - playing a jobber-luchador role whose ringname strongly suggested his sexual orientation. In his debut he was defeated by [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md). 

Boski made his next official appearance at [DDW House Show](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md) in March 2015 under his unmasked alias - Boski Ostrowski. He adapted the babyface persona of a flamboyant dancer, which he maintained and later developed throughout his career. He was unable to score any victories as he was defeated both in his Singles Match against [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and in a Rookie Battle Royal later that night. He made an apperance at the last DDW show at [Baltikon](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md). 

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2020)

#### Debut

After DDW folded their operations, Boski immedietaly joined [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), which was DDW's successor. At the KPW first show, [KPW vs the World: Hung(a)ry for Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), he teamed up with [Victor Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) against the members of Kawaleria - [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) and [GREG](@/w/greg.md). After that Ostrowski started making regular apperances at KPW shows, posing as a babyface accompanied by his manager - and a part-time tag team partner - [Mira](@/w/mira.md). At the first few [Arena](@/e/kpw/2016-02-27-kpw-arena-1.md) events he managed to score a few victories against rivals such as [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md), Victor Rosetti and Luxus. 

#### Teaming with Oliwa

At [Godzina Zero 2016](@/e/kpw/2016-08-13-kpw-godzina-zero-2016.md) Ostrowski alligned himself with [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) to fight against Luxus and GREG - this time he was defeated, after GREG pinned Oliwa. They managed to get back on track after their Tag Team victory over [Mateusz Kowalski](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md) and Rosetti at [KPW Arena 4](@/e/kpw/2016-11-26-kpw-arena-4-nowy-rozdzial.md). Boski and Oliwa teamed up rather regularly up until they lost to Kawaleria at [Szlamfest](@/e/kpw/2017-02-04-kpw-szlamfest.md) in February 2017. 

#### Championships pursuits

Shortly after, at [KPW Arena 6](@/e/kpw/2017-04-08-kpw-arena-6-selekcja.md), Ostrowski managed to earn an oportunity to challenge Piękny Kawaler for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md). The match took place at [KPW Arena 7](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7-wysoka-stawka.md), but Ostrowski was unable to defeat the leader of Kawaleria. 
After his defeat in the KPW Championship match, Ostrowski managed to stay relevant in championship pursuits. He was one of the contenders in both Magnificent Seven Ladder Match at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), and in a #1 Contender Match for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md). 

#### Sojusz

During the build-up for [KPW Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md), Boski Ostrowski - along with Mira - was convinced by [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) to join "Sojusz" (_The Alliance_), an impromptu alliance of babyfaces against the villainous Kawaleria. At said show he alligned himself with another Sojusz member, [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), to face Mateusz Kowalski & [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md), as well as Rosetti, who was left without a tag team partner. At [Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md) Ostrowski was defeated by the debuting powerhouse [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md). At [KPW OldTown 3](@/e/kpw/2018-07-14-kpw-oldtown-3.md) he was a part of defeated Sojusz, when he fought in a Six-Man Tag Team Match against Kawaleria. 

#### Reunion and programme with David Oliwa

After the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament was announced, Ostrowski quickly alligned himself with his old teammate David Oliwa. At [KPW Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md) they managed to advance to the finals of the tournament, defeating the team of [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) & Greg, and the British Bouncer Club. They were however defeated by [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and Rosetti in the finals. This marked the first major crack in their relationship, which was further developed when they were set up for a match at [KPW Arena 12](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12-gwiazda-polnocy.md) with KPW OldTown Championship #1 Contender spot as a stake. Oliwa defeated his tag team partner, which caused Boski Ostrowski to turn on him after the match. At the [next show](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md) Ostrowski tried to challenge David for a match, but was booked against [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md). He managed to emerge victorious in that match, and even got into a physical altercation with Oliwa.

At [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) Ostrowski managed to win the Magnificent Seven Elimination Ladder Match, which allowed him to face his ex-friend Oliwa for the KPW OldTown Championship. Along with a change in his persona, he also adopted a new ringname - Boski 2.0 - which supposedly marked a new chapter in his career. [Chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) decided to add one more opponent to the planned match - Greg - which was negatively recepted by Boski 2.0. At [KPW Arena 15](@/e/kpw/2019-11-16-kpw-arena-15-swieza-krew.md) the scheduled match took place, but Boski 2.0 was again unable to defeat his rival. At [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md) Boski 2.0 demanded a rematch against Oliwa, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a long hiatus between Arena 16 and the [next show](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md), these plans were scrapped. Boski 2.0 ultimately left KPW sometime between 2020 and 2021.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

Boski 2.0, along with numerous other ex-KPW wrestlers, joined a new federation created in the Silesia region by [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md): [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). However, just like the numerous other "Blues", he only limited himself to promoting the federation on his social media without securing any bookings.
