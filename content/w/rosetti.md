## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2015)

Rosetti trained under [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) and appeared as a rookie in two DDW shows, but his official debut didn't happen until DDW folded and was superseded by KPW.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

#### Debut

Initially performing as a solo wrestler, Rosetti debuted at [KPW Arena 1](@/e/kpw/2016-02-27-kpw-arena-1.md). During his early days in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) he was portraying a heel persona and failed to score a single victory for first two years in federation.

#### Teaming with Sawicki and KPW Tag Team Champion

Rosetti later started teaming with [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) while joining [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) in his stable called "Kawaleria". In November 2018 Sawicki and Rosetti won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md). Eventually, however, they lost the title at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md) to The Hunt (Primate & Wild Boar). Rosetti blamed Sawicki for the loss and, in a fit or anger, attacked him with a chair after the match. The onslaught was so brutal that Sawicki was never seen in KPW again (in reality, he left for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) where he trained, but never performed). This incident would end up earning him the nickname "Sadysta z Łodzi" (_The Sadist from [Łódź][boat-city]_), first heard in his promo for [Arena 20](@/e/kpw/2022-12-16-kpw-arena-20.md).

#### Joining Gałąź Gregoriańska and KPW OldTown Champion 

Following the loss of the Tag Team title, Rosetti returned to wrestling solo; he was supposed to pair with [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) at [Arena 18](2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md), however he was late for the event and missed his fight. Soon after that he would join Gałąź Gregoriańska (_The Gregorian Branch_), a heel stable led by [Greg](@/w/greg.md), and at [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) he won the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) by defeating David Oliwa in a less-than-savoury manner. This victory was followed by a number of strong international opponents, such as Flexos, Ludy Lohan or Zak Knight. Rosetti's string of victories as a champion abruptly ended at [Arena 25](2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) when [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), a fellow Gregorian Branch member, backstabbed Rosetti and claimed the OldTown title for himself. This situation resulted in Rosetti eventually turning on Greg and ending the Gałąź Gregoriańska.

#### Acting chairman of KPW

At [KPW Arena 26: Wyścig](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) Rosetti faced his old leader - Greg - in a [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) Number One Contender Qualifying Match. Their fight ended in no-contest after both of them got involved in a brawl with foregin objects and KPW Chairman [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) ruled so. Soon after he was attacked by mysterious masked figure, which resulted in his absence. At the end of the show Rosetti announced, that he was supposedly named the "acting chairman" by Malinowski.

Rosetti is one of the most experienced [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestlers still on the active roster, next to [Greg](@/w/greg.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), with roots in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).
