## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2015)

Rosetti trained under [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) and appeared as a rookie at two DDW shows, but his official debut didn't happen until after DDW folded and was superseded by KPW.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

#### Debut

Initially performing as a solo wrestler, Rosetti debuted at [KPW Arena 1](@/e/kpw/2016-02-27-kpw-arena-1.md). During his early days in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) he was portraying a heel persona and failed to score a single victory for the first two years in the federation.

#### Teaming with Sawicki and KPW Tag Team Champion

Rosetti later teamed up with [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md), while at the same time joining [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) in his stable called "Kawaleria" (_The Cavalry_). In November 2018 Sawicki and Rosetti won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md). Eventually, however, they lost the title at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md) to The Hunt ([Primate](@/w/primate.md) & Wild Boar). Rosetti blamed Sawicki for the loss and, in a fit or anger, attacked him with a chair after the match. The onslaught was so brutal that Sawicki was never seen in KPW again (in reality, he left for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) where he trained, but never performed). This incident would end up earning him the nickname "Sadysta z Łodzi" (_The Sadist from [Łódź][boat-city]_), first heard in his promo for [Arena 20](@/e/kpw/2022-12-16-kpw-arena-20.md).

#### Joining Gałąź Gregoriańska and KPW OldTown Champion

Following the loss of the Tag Team title, Rosetti returned to wrestling solo; he was supposed to pair up with [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) at [Arena 18](2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md), however he was late for the event and missed his fight. Soon after that he would join Gałąź Gregoriańska (_The Gregorian Branch_), a heel stable led by [Greg](@/w/greg.md), and at [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) he won the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) by defeating David Oliwa in a less-than-savoury manner. This victory was followed by defending against a number of strong international opponents, such as Flexos, Ludy Lohan or Zak Knight. Rosetti's streak as a champion abruptly ended at [Arena 25](2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) when [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), a fellow Gregorian Branch member, backstabbed Rosetti and claimed the OldTown title for himself. This situation resulted in Rosetti eventually turning on Greg and ending the Gregorian Branch at the next [Godzina Zero](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md).

#### Acting chairman of KPW

At [KPW Arena 26: Wyścig](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) Rosetti faced his old leader, Greg, in a [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) Number One Contender Qualifying Match. Their fight ended in a no-contest after both of them got involved in a brawl outside of the ring, leading to them being counted out by the [referee](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md). Despite this, they continued to brawl, now introducing foreign objects, which led to the KPW Chairman [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) coming out of the backstage and officially disqualifying both from the tournament. Soon after, Malinowski was attacked by a mysterious masked figure and promptly moved to a hospital by the on-site medical crew. At the end of the show, Rosetti announced that he was supposedly named the "acting chairman" by Malinowski. The official poster for [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md) features Rosetti in a suit and tie, emulating a cover of a business-focused magazine, to further promote his new role.

Rosetti is one of the most experienced [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestlers still on the active roster, next to [Greg](@/w/greg.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), with roots in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).
