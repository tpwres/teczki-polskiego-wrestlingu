## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2015)

Rosetti trained under [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) and appeared as a rookie at two DDW shows, but his official debut didn't happen until after DDW folded and was superseded by KPW.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

#### Debut

Initially performing as a solo wrestler, Rosetti debuted at [KPW Arena 1](@/e/kpw/2016-02-27-kpw-arena-1.md). During his early days in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) he was portraying a heel persona and failed to score a single victory for the first two years in the federation.

#### Teaming with Sawicki and KPW Tag Team Champion

Rosetti later teamed up with [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md), while at the same time joining [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) in his stable called [Kawaleria](@/tt/kawaleria.md). In November 2018 Sawicki and Rosetti won the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md). Eventually, however, they lost the title at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md) to The Hunt ([Primate](@/w/primate.md) & Wild Boar). Rosetti blamed Sawicki for the loss and, in a fit or anger, attacked him with a chair after the match. The onslaught was so brutal that Sawicki was never seen in KPW again (in reality, he left for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) where he trained, but never performed). This incident would end up earning him the nickname "Sadysta z Łodzi" (_The Sadist from [Łódź][boat-city]_), first heard in his promo for [Arena 20](@/e/kpw/2022-12-16-kpw-arena-20.md).

#### Joining Gałąź Gregoriańska and KPW OldTown Champion

Following the loss of the Tag Team title, Rosetti returned to wrestling solo; he was supposed to pair up with [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) at [Arena 18](2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md), however he was late for the event and missed his fight. Soon after that he would join [Gałąź Gregoriańska](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md) (_The Gregorian Branch_), a heel stable led by [Greg](@/w/greg.md), and at [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) he won the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) by defeating David Oliwa in a less-than-savoury manner. This victory was followed by defending against a number of strong international opponents, such as Flexos, Ludy Lohan or Zak Knight. Rosetti's streak as a champion abruptly ended at [Arena 25](2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) when [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), a fellow Gregorian Branch member, backstabbed Rosetti and claimed the OldTown title for himself. This situation resulted in Rosetti eventually turning on Greg and ending the Gregorian Branch at the next [Godzina Zero](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md).

#### Acting chairman of KPW

At [KPW Arena 26: Wyścig](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) Rosetti faced his old leader, Greg, in a [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) Number One Contender Qualifying Match. Their fight ended in a no-contest after both of them got involved in a brawl outside of the ring, leading to them being counted out by the [referee](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md). Despite this, they continued to brawl, now introducing foreign objects, which led to the KPW Chairman [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) coming out of the backstage and officially disqualifying both from the tournament. Soon after, Malinowski was attacked by a mysterious masked figure and promptly moved to a hospital by the on-site medical crew. At the end of the show, Rosetti announced that he was supposedly named the "acting chairman" by Malinowski. The official poster for [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md) features Rosetti in a suit and tie, emulating a cover of a business-focused magazine, to further promote his new role.

#### Demotion to commentary

Following [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), Rosetti decided that KPW needs a proper, full-time chairman. He [announced][rosetti-zapowiada] that one would be inducted at [Arena 28](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) - without stating a name, but strongly implying himself (which was later confirmed).

At [Arena 28](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) an induction ceremony was held, in which [Piotr Opolski](@/w/piotr-opolski.md) swore in Rosetti as the new chairman. Before Rosetti could finish his oath, however, [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) made a surprise appearance. He stated that he'd never asked Rosetti to take over his duties as an acting chairman, and that he was disappointed in everyone for being so easily misled by one person. Malinowski then resumed his duties and one of his first decisions was to remove Rosetti from the active roster and move him over to commentary, to help [Krystian Czekaj](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md).

Prior to the demotion, Rosetti was one of the most experienced [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestlers remaining on the active roster, next to [Greg](@/w/greg.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), with roots in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025)

On 10.11.2025 [Legacy](@/o/low.md) announced that Rosetti will be the guest commentator for the show.
