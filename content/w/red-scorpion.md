## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2023-present)

Red Scorpion made his debut for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in March 2022 at [KPW Arena 18: Powrót Do Przyszłości](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md), where he defeated [Darius](@/w/darius.md) and [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) in a Triple Threat Match.

He returned over a year later and gained a title shot on a [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) at [KPW Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md). He succeeded in defeating the reigning champion, [Greg](@/w/greg.md), via submission. His reign lasted for 386 days, but during that time he only made two successful defenses in Poland, and two in Italy. After he beat Jack Jester at [Godzina Zero 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md), the winner of Magnificent Seven Contract Ladder Match, [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) ran in to cash his contract and won the Championship from the Italian wrestler. Red Scorpion tried to win back his Championship at [KPW Arena 26: Wyścig](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md), but the new champion managed to retain.
