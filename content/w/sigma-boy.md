## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

On January 30th, PTW announced the first quarter-final match for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), in which Max Speed is going to take on a debuting rookie. The rookie turned out to be Sigma Boy xD - a bright and playful character, inspired by generation Alpha Internet culture. He was acknowledged as Speed's real life pupil from Academy and after a competitive match, lost in quarter finals. Beside his own matches, he started to occasionally support Max Speed, evening the odds when his trainer got attacked.
At [PTW: Wiosenna Bijatyka](@/e/ptw/2025-03-15-ptw-wiosenna-bijatyka.md) he faced [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) in a losing effort. Later that night, he countered Brave's interference in a ladder match for PTW Underground Championship, helping Speed to become the inaugural champion.
[Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) started to set his sights on Sigma, trying to provide him with unsolicited "guidance". As part of that storyline, he gave Sigma a match for Bestya Slam Championship against [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) at [PTW: Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md). Still in an infancy stage of his career, Sigma Boy xD failed to defeat the reigning champion. 
At [PTW: Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md), he scored his first victory against El G.
Additionally, as part of new working relationship between PTW and Austrian promotion Rings of Europe, he was announced to compete at the promotion's SummerCrush show at 25.07.2025, marking his international debut.
