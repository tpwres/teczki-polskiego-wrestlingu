## Professional wrestling career

### 2023: Training and debut

Gustav started his pro wrestling training at PpW Dojo - an unofficial predecessor of Ewenement Dojo. He was trained mostly by [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), who later became Head Coach of Ewenement Dojo. Gustav made his debut at [PpW Mistrzowskie Rozdanie](@/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie.md) where he faced and defeated [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md). He quickly become a regular star on the PpW's events thanks to his villainous gimmick of ambitious corporate rat who despites "hobos" and "lowlifes", which was a clear shot towards PpW audience, which is predominantly loosely assossiated with more rebellious and alternative ways of life.

During his first matches in PpW he become one of most influential "traditional" wrestlers in PpW, focusing more on Classic Wrestling Matches than hardcore wrestling compared to other members of PpW roster. 
Besides PpW Gustav also made an apperance at cross-promotion show [MZW+PpW: Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md).

### 2024: Rise to main event

#### Joining "Zmowa" and becoming PpW Champion

At early 2024 Gustav alongside his personal trainer & bodyguard Jakub Linde formed an alliance with villainous PpW's producer [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md). This alliance will be lated called ["Zmowa"](@/a/the-collusion.md). Gustav was quickly pushed by Mister Z into a No Holds Barred Match against [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) at [PpW Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) with the winner gaining the #1 Contender spot for [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md). Gustav defeated his opponent and cashed-in his title shot after his ally - Mister Z - failed to defeat [Feager](@/w/feager.md) and [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) in a triple threat match. The title shot cash-in was succesful, thus Gustav Gryffin became 7th PpW Champion in history.

#### Zmowa vs Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie; feud with Samson

For the bigger part of 2024 Gustav became one of the most influential workers in PpW's roster, serving as Mister Z right hand and "The Face of the Company". Zmowa gathered more talents such as [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md.) & [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) as Legia Łysych, as well as [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Almost every member of Zmowa had to face off one of the babyfaces in company. After defeating Biesiad in a rematch for PpW Championship at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md) Gustav spent almost whole second half of the year feuding with [Samson](@/w/samson.md). With Team Zmowa eventually losing to Team Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie in a Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) Gustav emerged victorious from his feud with Będzin's Beast after defeating him in a Strap Match - thus ending their feud.
