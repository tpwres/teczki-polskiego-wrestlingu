## Professional wrestling career

### 2023: Training and debut

Gustav started his pro wrestling training at PpW Dojo - an unofficial predecessor of [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md).
He was trained mostly by [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), who later became the head coach of the Dojo.
Gustav made his debut at [PpW Mistrzowskie Rozdanie](@/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie.md), where he faced and defeated [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md).
He quickly become a regular star at PpW events, thanks to his villainous gimmick of an ambitious, ruthless corporate suit who despises "hobos" and "low-lifes", which was a clear shot at the PpW audience, which is predominantly loosely assossiated with more rebellious and alternative ways of life.

During his first matches in PpW he become one of most influential "traditional" wrestlers in PpW, focusing more on classic wrestling matches than hardcore wrestling, compared to other members of the PpW roster.
Besides PpW, Gustav also made an appearance at the cross-promotion show [MZW+PpW: Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md).

### 2024: Rise to the main event

#### Joining "Zmowa" and becoming PpW Champion

In the early 2024 Gustav, alongside his personal trainer and bodyguard Jakub Linde, formed an alliance with the villainous PpW producer, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md).
This alliance would be lated called ["Zmowa"](@/a/the-collusion.md). Gustav was quickly pushed by Mister Z into a No Holds Barred Match against [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), with the winner gaining the #1 Contender spot for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md).
Gustav defeated his opponent and cashed in his title shot after his ally Mister Z failed to defeat [Feager](@/w/feager.md) and champion [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) in a triple threat match.
The title shot cash-in was successful, thus Gustav Gryffin became the 7th PpW Champion in history.

#### Zmowa vs Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie; feud with Samson

For the better part of 2024, Gustav became one of the most influential workers in the PpW roster, serving as Mister Z's right-hand man and "The Face of the Company".
Zmowa gathered more talent such as [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) as Legia Łysych, as well as [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md).
Almost every member of Zmowa had to face off one of the babyfaces in the company.
After defeating Biesiad in a rematch for the PpW Championship at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), Gustav spent almost the whole second half of the year feuding with [Samson](@/w/samson.md).
With Team Zmowa eventually losing to Team Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie in a Ustawka (_Hooligan Street Fight_) Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), Gustav emerged victorious from his battle against the Beast from Będzin after defeating him in a Strap Match - thus ending their feud.
