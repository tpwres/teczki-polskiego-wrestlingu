## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2022-present)

#### Training and debut 

Gustav started his pro wrestling training at PpW Dojo - an unofficial predecessor of [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md).
He was trained mostly by [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), who later became the head coach of the Dojo.
Gustav made his debut at [PpW Mistrzowskie Rozdanie](@/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie.md), where he faced and defeated [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md).
He quickly become a regular star at PpW events, thanks to his villainous gimmick of an ambitious, ruthless corporate suit who despises "hobos" and "low-lifes", which was a clear shot at the PpW audience, which is predominantly loosely assossiated with more rebellious and alternative ways of life.
For the first few months of his career he was managed by [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md), until their falling out at [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) in December 2023..

During his first matches in PpW he become one of most influential "traditional" wrestlers in PpW, focusing more on classic wrestling matches than hardcore wrestling, compared to other members of the PpW roster.
Besides PpW, Gustav also made an appearance at the cross-promotion show [MZW+PpW: Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md).

#### Joining "Zmowa" and becoming PpW Champion 

In the early 2024 Gustav, alongside his personal trainer and bodyguard Jakub Linde, formed an alliance with the villainous PpW producer, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md).
This alliance would be lated called ["Zmowa"](@/a/the-collusion.md). Gustav was quickly pushed by Mister Z into a No Holds Barred Match against [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), with the winner gaining the #1 Contender spot for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md).
Gustav defeated his opponent and cashed in his title shot after his ally Mister Z failed to defeat [Feager](@/w/feager.md) and champion [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) in a triple threat match.
The title shot cash-in was successful, thus Gustav Gryffin became the 7th PpW Champion in history.

#### Zmowa vs Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie; feud with Samson 

For the better part of 2024, Gustav became one of the most influential workers in the PpW roster, serving as Mister Z's right-hand man and "The Face of the Company".
Zmowa gathered more talent such as [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) as Legia Łysych, as well as [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md).
Almost every member of Zmowa had to face off one of the babyfaces in the company.
After defeating Biesiad in a rematch for the PpW Championship at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), Gustav spent almost the whole second half of the year feuding with [Samson](@/w/samson.md).
With Team Zmowa eventually losing to Team Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie in a Ustawka (_Hooligan Street Fight_) Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), Gustav emerged victorious from his battle against the Beast from Będzin after defeating him in a Strap Match - thus ending their feud.

#### Feud with Gabriel Queen

At [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz z Krzesłami](@/e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md) Gustav faced [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). After the match he was attacked by [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) - who earlier that night earned a title shot for PpW Championship - who sodomized Gustav's rectum. Humaliated Gustav accepted the fact, that he would have to face Gabriel at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), but just before a match started he stated, that it would be a match with 15-minute time limit. Due to referee knock-out Gustav was able to retain his championship. 

At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) Gustav teamed up with [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) to face Pure Gold. The match resulted in Gustav's and Isnorr's defeat after [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) pinned Isnorr. Nevertheless it was first Gustav's defeat during his title reign, so Gabriel challenged Gustav for a rematch at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md). The match was set up in a Two Out Of Three Falls Stipulation, and during the match just before Gabriel Queen was able to go for a second pinfall and victory, he was struck with a chair by his long time friend Vic Golden, which allowed Gustav to defeat Gabriel and end their feud.

#### The Last Dance

After 20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match in a main event of Teraz Albo Nigdy [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) became #1 Contender for PpW Championship, and the match will take place at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md). Due to fact, that it would be the third official match between Goblin and Gustav, the Gustav vs Goblin III match will has been named "The Last Dance".

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023-present)

Gustav made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at the joint show [MZW+PpW Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md), where he defeated Chris Cage in a Singles Match.
He later made another appearance over a year later at the next MZW show, [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), where he successfully defended his PpW Championship against [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md). Contrary to his PpW reception, in MZW he is portrayed as a babyface persona, without any dramatic changes to his gimmick.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

In November 2024 it was announced that Gustav will face [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) in a match for PpW Championship at [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md)'s [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). Following Wiktor's withdrawal due to real-life reasons, Gustav's opponent has been changed to [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md). Despite initially being ruled as Axel victory via pinfall, the match was restarted after a intervention from LoW's Chairman and [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) due to fact, that Gustav's hand was outside of the ring, which was unnoticed by a [Referee Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md). After a restart Gustav submitted Axel in a quick fashion.

On 22.03.2025 it was announced that Gustav will face Polish-American wrestler Kubes in a "Road To Title Match" which will take place at [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md)
