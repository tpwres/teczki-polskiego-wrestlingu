Piękny Kawaler (roughly _Beautiful Bachelor_, or _Lovely Lad_) is the owner of [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).
He started his wrestling career by training in the Source Wrestling School in Glasgow where he worked as a babyface.
After returning to Poland he joined [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), where he gained notoriety as a heel, known for his eccentric promos.

After DDW folded, he moved to the newly-opened KPW, eventually becoming the first KPW Champion.
His last in-ring appearance was at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) where he lost a Career vs Career Match against [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md).
Since then he assumed the role of head coach.
