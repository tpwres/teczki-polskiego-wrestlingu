## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Piękny Kawaler started his wrestling career by training in the Source Wrestling School in Glasgow where he worked as a babyface.
After returning to Poland he joined [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), where he gained notoriety as a heel, known for his eccentric promos. In 2015 he formed a heel stable called "Kawaleria", with [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) and [Greg](@/w/greg.md) as his subordinates. 

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

After DDW transfered into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Kawaler stayed in the federation eventually becoming one of the most prominent characters in the federation. He remained as the leader of Kawaleria, and defeated [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) to become first ever [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md). 

#### KPW Champion and feud with Robert Star

After his victory over Kamil Aleksander, Piękny Kawaler ran a successful campagin of numerous championship defences over foregin wrestlers such as Elliott Jordan, Pastor William Eaver or Wild Boar. In March 2018 at [Arena 9: Na Krawędzi](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md) Kawaler along with his stable have officialy established themselves as a opponents for babyface faction under [Robert Star's](@/w/robert-star.md) leadership called "Sojusz". At the next show - [Arena X: Kawaleria vs Sojusz](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md) Kawaler faced Robert for his KPW Championship in a Lumberjack Match. He managed to defeat The Polish Stallion, but eventually lost the championship to [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), who managed to earn a contract for a title match earlier the same night. 

Despite loss of his championship Kawaler managed to earn another asset - Robert's defeat meant that he was forced to join Kawaleria. They even managed to got into Semi Finals Match for [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) but they got disqualified after Kawaler was found to be under influence, and got suspended after assaulting a referee, but during that suspention period he runned for chairman position of Kombat Pro Wrestling, ultimatevly losing to Krystian Malinowski at [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md). At the same show Robert Star managed to win KPW Championship. Kawaler - still acting as Robert's leader - claimed a championship as his own. This resulted in Robert finally breaking free from Kawaleria, but also resulted in him being released from KPW for breaking a deal between him and Kawaler.

At [KPW Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) Piękny Kawaler once again stood again his career-long nemesis: Robert Star. This time it was a KPW Championship Career vs Career Last Man Standing Match. Piękny Kawaler lost this bout, and later on got backstabbed by his long-time allies from Kawaleria. This marks his last official apperance in Kombat Pro Wrestling.
