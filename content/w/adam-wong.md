## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2021-2023)

Adam Wong made his official debut at [PpW Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md). He adopted "Polski Smok" (Polish Dragon) gimmick heavy inspired by classic kung-fu movies from 1970s and video games. He was present during first years of PpW "Professional" era making numerous apperances on [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) shows. 

Due to fast development of PpW and ongoing professionalisation of roster, especially after arrival of numerous "Prime Time Transfers" deals made by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) in 2023/2024 Adam Wong dropped down the card. Most propably it was caused by his lack of in-ring improvement. At the end of 2023 Adam Wong decided to part ways with PpW.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Training

Adam Wong quickly joined [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) shortly after leaving PpW. He attended their training weekends and summer camp, and was spotted by public working as a part of ring crew at numerous KPW shows in 2024.
