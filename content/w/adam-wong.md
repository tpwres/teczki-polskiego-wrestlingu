## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2021-2023)

Adam Wong made his official debut at [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md). He adopted the "Polski Smok" (_Polish Dragon_) gimmick, heavily inspired by classic kung-fu movies from 1970s, as well as fighting video games. He was present during the first years of PpW's professional era, making numerous appearances at PpW shows.

Due to the quick development of PpW and ongoing professionalisation of the roster, especially after the arrival of numerous ["Prime Time Transfers"](@/a/ptw-exits.md) following deals made by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) in 2023/2024, Adam Wong dropped down the card. This was most likely caused by his lack of in-ring improvement. At the end of 2023 Adam Wong decided to part ways with PpW.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Training

Adam Wong quickly joined [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) shortly after leaving PpW. He attended their training weekends and the 2024 summer camp, and was spotted by fans working as part of the ring crew at numerous KPW shows the same year. In 2025, at [KPW in Kadzidło](@/e/kpw/2025-09-06-kpw-kadzidlo.md), he made his first in-ring appearance, albeit still as a rookie (announced as "Adam").
