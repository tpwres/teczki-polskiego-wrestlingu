## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2021-2023)

Before his official debut as Adam Wong, he made his first appearance for [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) at [2KOŁA To My Nie Zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md) pre-show against [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md)

Adam Wong made his official debut at [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md). He adopted the "Polski Smok" (_Polish Dragon_) gimmick, heavily inspired by classic kung-fu movies from 1970s, as well as fighting video games. He was present during the first years of PpW's professional era, making numerous appearances at PpW shows.

Due to the quick development of PpW and ongoing professionalisation of the roster, especially after the arrival of numerous ["Prime Time Transfers"](@/a/ptw-exits.md) following deals made by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) in 2023/2024, Adam Wong dropped down the card. This was most likely caused by his lack of in-ring improvement. At the end of 2023 Adam Wong decided to part ways with PpW.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Training & rookie appearances

Adam Wong quickly joined [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) shortly after leaving PpW. He attended their training weekends and the 2024 summer camp, and was spotted by fans working as part of the ring crew at numerous KPW shows the same year. During the build-up for [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md) Adam - alongside numerous other trainees - addressed [chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md), stating they're fed up with being bullied by [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) and demanding a match against him. Malinowski replied by arranging a Battle Royal to determine who would face Tomczak at Godzina Zero 2025. Adam didn't secure a spot in this fight, but later that year at [KPW in Kadzidło](@/e/kpw/2025-09-06-kpw-kadzidlo.md) he made his first in-ring appearance facing Tomczak, albeit still as a rookie (announced as "Adam").
