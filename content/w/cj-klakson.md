## Professional wrestling career

### Before Debut (2019-2025)

CJ Klakson was initially a [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) trainee, but never debuted for the organization. After leaving the KPW school, he spent 2024-2025 training in wXw Academy's beginner group.
In July 2025, Klakson created his Instagram profile and started uploading pre-taped promo vignettes. According to them, he was a "simple boy from Fordon, Bydgoszcz", chasing his dream of becoming a wrestler.
Further vignettes emphasised Klakson's "hottest free agent" status, seeing him answer multiple phone calls from all over the world.

#### Debut and first matches

In another vignette, Klakson received a call from PTW commentator and wannabe talent agent [Adam Goldschmidt](@/w/adam-goldschmidt.md), who put him in contact with both PTW chairmen.
He promised to make his decision at [PTW: Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md).

At that show, Klakson debuted in an in-ring promo segment. Donning the Polish national colours, he declared that despite multiple lucrative offers from around the world, he chose his home country of Poland as a place to further develop his wrestling career, and that he has signed with PTW.

Over the following months, Klakson worked exclusively against international competitors, establishing a short winning streak and highlighting his patriotic gimmick.
