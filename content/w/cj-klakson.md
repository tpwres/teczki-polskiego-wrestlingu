## Professional wrestling career 

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Debut and first matches

In July 2025, Klakson created his Instagram profile and started uploading pre-taped promo vignettes. According to them, he is a "simple boy from Fordon, Bydgoszcz" who is chasing his dream of becoming a wrestler. Further vignettes emphasised Klakson's "hottest free agent" status, seeing him answer multiple phone calls from all over the world. Eventually, Klakson received a call from PTW commentator and wannabe talent agent [Adam Goldschmidt](@/w/adam-goldschmidt.md), who put him in contact with both PTW chairmen.

At [PTW: Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md) Klakson made his debut in an in-ring promo segment. Donning the Polish national colours, he declared that despite lucrative offers from around the world he chose his home country of Poland as a place to further develop his wrestling career.
Over the following months, Klakson worked exclusively against international competitors, establishing a short winning streak and highlighting his patriotic gimmick.
