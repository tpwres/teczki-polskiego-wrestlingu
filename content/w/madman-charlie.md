## Professional wrestling career

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2017)

Charlie Grayson made his debut in [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) - of which he was one of the founding members - in June 2015 at their [first show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md). From this point on he managed to make numerous regular appearances. At [Tournament of Dreams II](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md) he advanced to the finals of the tournament to face [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) for the [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md), but he was unable to secure a victory. He managed to earn yet another opportunity at [DFW Christmas Brawl 2016](@/e/dfw/2016-12-06-dfw-christmas-brawl.md), where he defeated [Direk](@/w/direk.md) for the #1 Contender spot, but again, he was defeated by Chris Hunter at [Love Hurts, Wrestling Even More](@/e/dfw/2017-02-14-dfw-love-hurts-wrestling-even-more.md) on Valentine's Day 2017.

Charlie made his final appearance for DFW at [DFW Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md) in September 2017. After that he left DFW to focus on other endeavours.

### PpW (2016)

In 2016 Charlie made a one-time guest appearance in backyard-era [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), where he fought against PpW star [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) in a Singles Match at [Backyard Total War](@/e/ppw/2016-07-18-ppw-backyard-total-war.md). Later on, he also was involved in a [raid on a PpW facility][szkoda] at [Winogronowa 17](@/v/winogronowa-17.md), where he and Direk jumped Rob Scaffold and [Cade Bruce](@/w/mister-z.md), who were mourning the loss of their ring. This angle didn't lead to any further storylines.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2017-2021)

In 2017 Charlie started his training in [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) Academy, later to be renamed to [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md). After his departure from Dream Factory Wrestling, he focused solely on working for MZW, which resulted in his debut in a Battle Royal at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) in December 2017, where he debuted under his "Karol Górski" ringname.

After his debut he adopted "Madman Charlie" as his official ringname, and performed regularly for Maniac Zone Wrestling during their "Project Era", from October 2018 to January 2020. During that time Charlie frequently teamed up with [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), with the two supporting each other during their matches. At that time he also became one of the founding members of a backstage group, which would later be named ["Zieloni"](@/tt/zieloni.md).

At [MZW Project 1: New Beggining](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) Charlie defeated [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) by DQ, which allowed him to advance in a tournament for the [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). This allowed him to take part in a Fatal Four Way Match for the championship at [Project 2: Four](@/e/mzw/2018-12-08-mzw-project-2-four.md), but he was unable to secure a victory against [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Damien Rothschild](@/w/damian-lambert.md) and [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md). From this point on Madman was moved to the upper midcard, working mostly multi-man matches.

After the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Madman Charlie starred in a pre-taped MZW show called [MZW Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md), where he broke up his alliance with Crane and defeated him in a Two Out Of Three Falls Loser Leaves MZW Match. His participation in the [sixth episode](@/e/mzw/2021-07-21-mzw-project-basement-6.md) of Project Basement marked the last time he officially worked for Maniac Zone Wrestling, as he, along with numerous other members of "Zieloni", left MZW.

### Return to PpW Ewenement (2021-present)

#### Irregular appearances

Madman Charlie returned to PpW during their first show after the pandemic - [Ledwo Legalne I](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) - where he faced [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Since then, he worked two matches, at [Poznań Supershow 2021](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md), and at [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md), where he teamed up with [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md) against [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md). His appearances, however, were limited due to a back injury, which prevented him from working in the ring full-time.

#### Becoming a referee & part-time wrestling

Charlie, now again working under his "real-life" name Karol Górski, resumed his regular appearances in PpW by debuting as a referee at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) in February 2024. Since then, he made numerous regular appearances, working alongside [Referee Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md) and later also [Referee Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md).

At [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) Karol Górski unexpectedly took part in the Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match, hosted by [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). Later on, he also worked a match against Isnorr at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md), a non-canon show in Poznań.

#### Feud with Olgierd

In a post-match interview at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - a member of [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) - physically assaulted referee Kornel. This prompted him to cut a promo on all the "zebras" (referring to the referees' black-and-white striped shirts), whom he despises on an ideological basis, being a rule-breaking hooligan. He challenged all the referees to a gauntlet match at [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md). Karol was the second of the referees to face Olgierd, but he was unable to score a victory over the Polish hooligan.
