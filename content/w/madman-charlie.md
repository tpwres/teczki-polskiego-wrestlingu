## Professional wrestling career 

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2017)

Charlie Grayson made his debut in [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) - which he was one of the founding members - in June 2015 at their [first show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md). From this point on he managed to make numerous regular apperances. At [Tournament of Dreams II](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md) he advanced to the finals of the tournament to face [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) for [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md), but he was unable to secure a victory. He managed to earn yet another opportunity at [DFW Christmas Brawl 2016](@/e/dfw/2016-12-06-dfw-christmas-brawl.md), where he defeated [Direk](@/w/direk.md) for #1 Contender spot, but again, he was defeated by Chris Hunter at [Love Hurts, Wrestling Even More](@/e/dfw/2017-02-14-dfw-love-hurts-wrestling-even-more.md) on Valentines Day 2017. 

Charlie made his last apperance for DFW at [DFW Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md) in September 2017. After that he left DFW to focus on other endeavours.

### PpW Ewenement (2016)

In 2016 Charlie made a guest apperance in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), where he fought against PpW star [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) in a Singles Match at [Backyard Total War](@/e/ppw/2016-07-18-ppw-backyard-total-war.md). Later on, he also was involved in a [raid on a PpW facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYOI3S-LVjg) at [Winogronowa 17](@/v/winogronowa-17.md), where himself and Direk attacked Rob Scaffold and [Cade Bruce](@/w/mister-z.md), who were mourning the loss of the ring. The angle itself was not leading to any further storyline.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2017-2021)

Charlie started his training in [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) Academy - later to be renamed to [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md) in 2017. After his departure from Dream Factory Wrestling he focused solely on working for MZW, which resulted in his debut in a Battle Royal at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) in December 2017, where he debuted under his "Karol Górski" ringname.

After his debut he adopted "Madman Charlie", as his official ringname, which led him to making rather regular apperances for Maniac Zone Wrestling during their "Project Era" from October 2018 to January 2020. During that time Charlie frequently teamed up with [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), supporting each other during their matches. During that time he also became one of the founding members of backstage group, which will be later named ["Zieloni"](@/a/the-greens.md). 

At [MZW Project 1: New Beggining](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) he defeated [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) by DQ, which allowed him to advance in a tournament for [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). This allowed him to took part in a Fatal Four Way Match for said championship at [Project 2: Four](@/e/mzw/2018-12-08-mzw-project-2-four.md), but he was unable to secure a win over [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Damien Rotschild](@/w/damien-rotschild.md) and [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md). From this point on Madman was moved to upper midcard, working mostly multi-man matches. 

After pandemic lockdown Madman Charlie starred in a pre-taped MZW show called [MZW Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md), where he broke up his alliance with Crane, and defeated him in a Two Out Of Three Falls Loser Leaves MZW Match. Apperance in [sixth episode](@/e/mzw/2021-07-21-mzw-project-basement-6.md) of Project Basement marked his last official apperance for Maniac Zone Wrestling, as he, along with numerous other members of "Zieloni" leaved the MZW. 

### Return to PpW Ewenement (2021-present)

#### Irregular apperances

Madman Charlie returned to PpW during their first show after pandemic - [Ledwo Legalne I](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) - where he faced [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Since that point on he made two more apperances as Madman Charlie. He worked at [PpW Poznań Supershow 2021](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md), and at [PpW Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md), where he teamed up with [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md) against [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md). His apperances was however limited, due to back injury, which prevented him from working as in-ring performer full time.

#### Becoming a referee & part-time wrestling apperances

Charlie, now again working under his "real-life" name Karol Górski, made his return to regular apperances in PpW by debuting as referee at [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) in February 2024. Since then, he made numerous regular apperances, working alongside [Referee Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md) and later also [Referee Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md).

At [PpW Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) Karol Górski surprisingly took part in Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match, which was hosted by [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). Later on, he also worked a match against Isnorr at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md) non-canon show in Poznań. 

#### Feud with Olgierd

In a post-match interview at [PpW Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) a member of [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md) - [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - physically assaulted referee Kornel, which prompted him to cut a promo on all of "Zebras", who he despites on a ideological ground as he is a rule-breaking hooligan. He challenged all of the referees to a gauntlet match, which will took place on [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md).
