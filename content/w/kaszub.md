## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Kaszub made his debut in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in October 2013 at [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md), where he first fought against [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) in a Singles Match which was ruled No Contest, and in a Battle Royal later that night. Since his debut he adopted a babyface-leaning persona of Kashubian warrior - a gimmick heavily inspired by an ethnic minority from the Polish Pomerania region: the [Kashubians][kaszebe]. In total, he made nine appearances at DDW events with Mixed Tag Team match at [Baltikon 2015](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md) being his last one.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2018)

Kaszub was one of the first wrestlers to join the new federation - [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) - after DDW folded its operations. In his first match in KPW, which took place at their first show: [Hung(a)ry For Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), he was defeated by [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md). For some time he was still portrayed as babyface, but later on he joined Kawaleria, a heel stable led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), losing much of his Kashubian-based gimmick and becoming one of Kawaler's brutes. He made his last appearance for KPW at [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md) where he was set up to fight against his collegue from Kawaleria, [Greg](@/w/greg.md). In a title match for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) they reenacted the "Fingerpoke of Doom" match - Kaszub tanked the match which allowed Greg to secure a quick victory. This marked Kaszub's last appearance in KPW, which was announced by Piękny Kawaler on his social media along with Kaszub's discharge from Kawaleria. Following that, Kaszub retired from professional wrestling.
