## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2014)

Ron Corvus made a few apperances at [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) shows back in 2013 and 2014. His most notorious achievement from that time is advancement to the semi-finals of [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) tournament, where he was defeated by [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

Corvus returned to Poland at first [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) show: [KPW vs the World: Hung(a)ry for Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md). From that moment on he started making rather regular apperances for polish federation, becoming sort of "Hardcore Match expert" in KPW. At [KPW Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md) he won Magnificent Seven No Disqualification Elimination Ladder Match for a [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) Title Match, which he had cashed-in at [KPW Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md). Cash-in was successful and thus Ron Corvus became KPW Champion.

Corvus held his title for less than a year before being defeated by [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) at [KPW Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md). After that defeat his apperances became more limited, but after nearly 3 years of absence he made his return to KPW at [KPW Arena 18: Powrót do Przyszłości](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md).
