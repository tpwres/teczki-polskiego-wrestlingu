## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2012-2015)

Bianca made her in-ring debut working for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in 2012. She debuted by winning a 15-man Intergender Battle Royale at [DDW's show in Rzeszów](@/e/ddw/2012-03-09-ddw-6.md). For most of her DDW career, she fought mostly in Mixed Tag-Team Matches, worked as a manager, or fought the few other female wrestlers, such as [Mira](@/w/mira.md) and [Kasandra](@/w/kasandra.md). In total, she worked ten matches for DDW before the federation folded after [Baltikon](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md), where she temporary joined Kawaleria.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2022)

After DDW ceased operations and [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) was created, Bianca immediately joined the new federation. For some time she portrayed the character of KPW Chairman's spokeswoman, often appearing in KPW's videos and promos. Besides that she sometimes worked matches, mostly against fellow female wrestlers such as Mira, [Alisa](@/w/alisa.md) and international female talent such as Sixt and Aurora Flame. She fought her last match at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md), where she defeated [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md). After that she seemingly retired from in-ring activity. However, from 2021 to 2022 she still made several appearances on KPW's social media, hosting her talk-show program [Cafe Bianca][cafe-bianca].
