## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut and lowcard appearances

Marcelito started his training in PTW Academy in early 2021 while the federation was still preparing to reveal themselves to the public. Alongside [Taras](@/w/taras.md), [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) and a few others, he was one of the first alumni of the Silesia-based pro-wrestling school.

Marcelito made his debut at [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md)'s first show, [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), as enhancement talent.
He wrestled under his real-life name against [Taxi Złotówa](@/w/taxi-zlotowa.md) - a microinfluencer and freakfighter, recruited by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).
His last name - Budzianowski - was a part of the storyline conflict between Pawłowski and the heelish Złotówa, as the PTW promoter supposedly promised Złotówa a match against the accomplished MMA Fighter and Strongman [Mariusz Pudzianowski][pudzian], whose last name sounds very similar to "Budzianowski". Marcelito lost his match in a couple of seconds.

Later on, Marcelito was still used as enhancement talent to build up more promoted characters, such as [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) and [Remo](@/w/remo.md).

#### Formation of Bright Lights and breaking the streak

At [PTW Underground 6](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md) Marcelito formed an alliance with [Karol "Iskra" Górski](@/w/iskra.md) - another enhancement talent and ex-referee who previously worked for [KPW](@/o/kpw.md).
They called themselves "The Bright Lights" and tagged in a rather part-time fashion, while simultaneously maintaining their solo careers.
Marcelito continued his losing streak - both solo and in tag team with Iskra - up until [PTW Underground 9](/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md), when he finally defeated one of the main event stars - Puncher - who was distracted by [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), his rival.
Since then Marcelito's position in the card improved slightly, as he was able to run longer and more close fights.

#### Bright Lights breakup

After Bright Light lost their match against Pure Gold in the first round of the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament at [PTW Underground 11](@/e/ptw/2023-01-29-ptw-underground-11.md), Iskra attacked Marcelito, effectively turning heel on him.
That led to a short-lived feud with Marcelito losing to Iskra at [PTW Underground 13](@/e/ptw/2023-03-26-ptw-underground-13.md).
Then he interrupted Iskra at [the next Underground show](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md), where he attacked Karol Górski while he was trying to court [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md).
At [PTW Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md) his match against [Samson](@/w/samson.md) was interrupted by Iskra leading to a DQ finish.
Later, Iskra also took part in a segment before Marcelito's rematch against Samson at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), but with that their feud was finished, as Iskra moved to feuding with Diana Strong instead.

#### Feud with Sinister Kingdom and formation of Samsonito

After his programme with Iskra, Marcelito spent almost the full second half of 2023 feuding with [The Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md) - [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md).
He was defeated by the "reborn" Dziedzic at [PTW x Ryucon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) and tried to fend off Sinister Kingdom members when they attacked Samson at the same show.
The feud continued for the next two Undergrounds, where Samson and Marcelito failed to score even a single victory over Sinister's stable, both in singles competitions and as a tag team, dubbed "Samsonito" as a portmanteau of their names.
At [Underground 20](@/e/ptw/2023-12-10-ptw-underground-20.md) they were defeated by Legia Łysych. This marked the final appearance of Samson in PTW, and thus the end of Samsonito.

During that time Marcelito also made his international debut, fighting for the Austrian promotion Rings of Europe in September 2023, where he was defeated by [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md).

#### Championship pursuits and departure

In early 2024, Marcelito took part in the [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) Rumble Match for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). He entered the match as number two and was the 15th person to be eliminated, by Krampus.

Later in the year, Marcelito competed for the PTW Tag Team Championship against Budapest Bastards, while teaming with [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) at [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md).
The attempt was unsuccessful, just like his title fight against Axel Fox and Scotty Rawk for the British Wrestling Revolution Championship at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md).
After the end of the fight Axel teased a possible heelturn, or at least rivalry with Marcelito, but due to their departure from PTW it ultimately led to nothing.

On Sunday, June 2nd 2024, a rumor was posted on the PTW Facebook fan group that Marcelito, along with Dziedzic and Sinister, have been [released by PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md). The fans quickly linked these departures with the shoot interview with Dziedzic just days before, where Marcelito was reportedly active in the chat, agreeing with Dziedzic on topics related to PTW and Pawłowski's politics.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

After his departure from PTW, Marcelito was seen among numerous other ex-PTW wrestlers attending [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md) show [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md).
He also worked as ring crew and timekeeper at [PpW Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md).
Marcelito made his official in-ring debut at [PpW Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) facing his ex-PTW colleague Axel Fox.
About that time he developed his babyface persona, incorporating some humorous catchphrases such as "Kto zgasił światło?!" (_Who turned off the light?!_ - a reference to power failure during his match in PTW) as well as a new theme song.

At [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) Marcelito formed a tag team with [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md), dubbed _Platelito_, to face and defeat Hungarian wrestlers Atilla and Danny Roxx. At [Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-07-05-ppw-turniej-typeshit.md) he was eliminated by [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) in a Gauntlet Match. After that he teamed up with the Slavic Warrior against another Hungarian Team consisting of [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md) and [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md), but they were defeated by the masked hungarians.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-present)

In October 2024 Marcelito performed at [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) show [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) where he faced Syriusz Dziedzic and [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md). At [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) in March 2025 he faced [The Wolf](@/w/apollo-anderson.md), whom he managed to defeat.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

On 14th of August 2024 Marcelito was one of the wrestlers starring in the trailer for a new Polish wrestling federation - [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md).

In November 2024 it was announced that he would face MZW owner and legend [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) at [LoW's first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). Marcelito lost the match to the MZW high-flyer. At their [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) he faced another Polish wrestling scene veteran - [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) - in another unsuccessful bout.

## International wrestling appearances

In 2022 and 2023 Marcelito made a handful of appearances for Austiran promotions Rings of Europe and PTW:WWA, which was owned by the fellow PTW wrestler [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md).
