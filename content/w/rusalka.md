### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-2024)

In total, she made five appearances for PTW, with her last one taking place at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), after which she [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) along with Sambor.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-present)

Rusałka made her return in the role of Sambor's valet in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), working alongside him since his return to MZW at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md).

Rusałka accompanied Sambor during his debut for [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) at their [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), partnering with him ever since.
