## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-2024)

Rusałka made her debut at [Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md) as [Sambor's](@/w/sambor.md) valet, often accompanying him at ringside. In keeping with his Slavic theme, she is named after a [creature from Slavic folklore][rusalka]. The two seem to share a sort of mystical connection: Rusałka would often mimic Sambor's moves and also appear to suffer when Sambor is hit. In total, she made five appearances for PTW, with her last one taking place at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), after which she [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) along with Sambor.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-2025)

Rusałka made her return in the role of Sambor's valet in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), working alongside at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) and [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-2025)
