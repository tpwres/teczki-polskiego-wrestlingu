## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

Resivny joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) some time in late 2024. After the [2024 crisis in PTW](@/a/ptw-crisis.md) - which resulted in a [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in May/June, including all of PTW's commentators - Krystian pursued his career in PTW as a member of the commentary team. He made his debut at [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) where he was joined by [Adam Goldschmidt](@/w/adam-goldschmidt.md). Right from the start he was portrayed as a babyface commentator. He also became the host of "agResivne wywiady" - a series of live interview with PTW staff and wrestlers held on PTW's YouTube channel.
