## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2019)

#### Teaming with Bułecka

Stanisław Van Dobroniak made his debut on polish scene as a tag team partner of [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) in a tag team called "Zbójnicy". He rocked a gimmick of babyface polish-emmigrant working man to match his partner mountaineer gimmick. His first match took place at [Champions War](@/e/mzw/2015-05-31-mzw-champions-war.md) where he and Jędruś fought against Nickolas von Rijk and [Robert Kaiser](@/w/robert-kaiser.md) for 	BPWF Tag Team Championship. For the next couple of shows he made rather regular apperances working both solo and in a tag team. 

At [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md) Zbójnicy have won a match against [Kripto](@/w/kripto.md) and [Red Thunder](@/w/red-thunder.md) to become inaugural [MZW Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). They've managed to defend it against Catch Connection at [Revolution](@/e/mzw/2016-11-05-mzw-revolution.md) but lost to Storm Riders - Red Thunder and Blue Thunder - at [Charity Show 2017](@/e/mzw/2017-01-15-mzw-charity-show-2017.md). After that defeat and Bułecka's pause from in-ring competition Zbójnicy have benn disbanded.

#### Solo run

After MZW moved pernamently to Wrocław Stanisław has leaned more into comedy and gimmick character, much more like on a independent scene abroad. His gimmick was strongly influenced by video games characters like Wario from famous Super Mario Bros franchise. He took part in couple matches during MZW's Project era. He most notably feuded with returning Jędruś Bułecka - who attacked him after his match against [Lady Killer](@/w/boro.md) at [Project 4: Open Your Eyes](@/e/mzw/2019-03-23-mzw-project-4-open-your-eyes.md). This led to their Hardcore Match at [MZW Project 5: Hero](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md) where the fight was ended by double-KO. 

After one more apperance at [MZW Project 6](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) Dobroniak has eventually left the federation.

### PpW Ewenement (2022-present)

#### PpW European Ultraviolent Champion

Van Dobroniak made his return to polish scene after pandemic in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), where he quickly got into their ultraviolent division. In his debut at [Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md) he won a match against the champion - [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) - and Viking to become [PpW European Ultraviolent Champion](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md). Since then he ruled as a champion for 637 days. He lost his championship to Johnny Blade in a Born to be Wired Four Way Elimination Match at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md). 

Besides his championsip defences in Poland, Dobroniak also made few PpW EU UV Championship defences abroad. Most notably in swedish federations STHLM Wrestling and Freedom Pro Wrestling where he is making frequent apperances.

After his championship loss Stanisław has been inactive in PpW up until December 2024, where he was announced for [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) in January. He immediately aimed for now-reigning UV Champion - [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md)

## Other media

### Botchamania

Dobroniak was featured in [Botchamania 493][bm-493]. On April 6th, 2024, he took part in a six-man match at Freedom Pro Wrestling's "Öl och Bröl" (_Beer and Roar_) event in Västerhaninge near Stockholm.
The clip shows him trying to climb back into the ring from outside. One of his partners (Jack the Strangler or Strangler Jr) then bounces on the ropes, which causes Dobroniak to comically fall down to the outside again.
