## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2019)

#### Teaming with Bułecka

Stanisław Van Dobroniak made his debut on the Polish scene as the partner of [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) in a tag team called "[Zbójnicy](@/tt/zbojnicy.md)". He rocked a gimmick of a babyface Polish emigrant working man, to match his partner's [Góral][wiki-gorale] (Polish Highlander) gimmick. His first match took place at [Champions War](@/e/mzw/2015-05-31-mzw-champions-war.md) where he and Jędruś fought against Nickolas von Rijk and [Robert Kaiser](@/w/robert-kaiser.md) for the BPWF Tag Team Championship. For the next couple of shows he made rather regular appearances working both solo and in a tag team.

At [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md) Zbójnicy won a match against [Kripto](@/w/kripto.md) and [Red Thunder](@/w/red-thunder.md) to become the inaugural [MZW Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). They managed to defend it against Catch Connection at [Revolution](@/e/mzw/2016-11-05-mzw-revolution.md) but lost to [Storm Riders](@/tt/storm-riders.md) - Red Thunder and [Blue Thunder](@/w/blue-thunder.md) - at [Charity Show 2017](@/e/mzw/2017-01-15-mzw-charity-show-2017.md). After that defeat and Bułecka's pause from in-ring competition, Zbójnicy disbanded.

#### Solo run

After MZW moved permanently to Wrocław, Stanisław had leaned more into a comedy and gimmick character, much more like on the independent scene abroad. His gimmick was strongly influenced by video game characters like Wario from the famous Super Mario Bros. franchise. He took part in a couple matches during MZW's Project era. Most notably, he feuded with the returning Jędruś Bułecka, who attacked him after his match against [Lady Killer](@/w/boro.md) at [Project 4: Open Your Eyes](@/e/mzw/2019-03-23-mzw-project-4-open-your-eyes.md). This led to their Hardcore Match at [MZW Project 5: Hero](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md) which ended in a double-KO.

After one more match at [MZW Project 6](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md), Dobroniak eventually left the federation, choosing to focus on wrestling abroad.

### PpW Ewenement (2022-present)

#### PpW European Ultraviolent Champion

After the COVID-19 pandemic, Dobroniak made his return to the Polish scene in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), where he quickly got into their ultraviolent division. In his debut at [Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md) he won a match against Czech wrestler Viking and the champion [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), to become the [PpW European Ultraviolent Champion](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md). Since then, he has ruled as champion for 637 days. He lost his title to Johnny Blade in a Born to be Wired Four Way Elimination Match at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md).

Besides his championship defenses in Poland, Dobroniak also had a few PpW EU UV Championship defenses abroad, most notably in the Swedish federations STHLM Wrestling and Freedom Pro Wrestling where he makes frequent appearances.

After losing the championship, Stanisław had been inactive in PpW up until December 2024, when he was announced for [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) in January 2025. He immediately aimed for the now-reigning Ultraviolent Champion [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), but was defeated by him. Dobroniak also took part in the 20 Typa 20 Broni Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md).

#### Saving zombie Johnny

Before [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) Dobroniak posted his promo on social media, where he assumed the persona of Professor Dobroniak. His scientific research was focused on getting rid of Zombie Johnny, preferably without killing him. The most humane way he was able to determine was to submerge the zombie in non-alcoholic beer, which, the Professor was certain, would restore Johnny to his normal state.

In their match at the show, Zombie Johnny was different from his regular persona, mostly shambling slowly towards Dobroniak, trying to eat his brain, and no-selling many of his attacks. Eventually, Dobroniak was able to tie Johnny down with a length of barbed wire and dunk him in a bathtub filled with non-alcoholic beer, which quickly cured the zombie state. While nominally it was Dobroniak who won the match, the newly restored Johnny celebrated the victory with him and the fans.

## Other media

Stockholm Life, a Swedish YouTube channel, produced a short documentary about Dobroniak, titled "[The Polish Adonis](https://youtu.be/ywh7FwyQCEw)". In it, Dobroniak talks (in Swedish, with English subtitles) about "combining his private and wrestling life by prioritizing wrestling in almost every aspect".

### Botchamania

Dobroniak was featured in [Botchamania 493][bm-493]. On April 6th, 2024, he took part in a six-man match at Freedom Pro Wrestling's "Öl och Bröl" (_Beer and Roar_) event in Västerhaninge near Stockholm.
The clip shows him trying to climb back into the ring from the outside. One of his partners (Jack the Strangler or Strangler Jr) then bounces on the ropes, which causes Dobroniak to comically fall down to the outside again.
