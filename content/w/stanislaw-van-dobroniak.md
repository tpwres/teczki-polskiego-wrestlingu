### Botchamania

Dobroniak was featured in [Botchamania 493][bm-493]. On April 6th, 2024, he took part in a six-man match at Freedom Pro Wrestling's "Öl och Bröl" (_Beer and Roar_) event in Västerhaninge near Stockholm.
The clip shows him trying to climb back into the ring from outside. One of his partners (Jack the Strangler or Strangler Jr) then bounces on the ropes, which causes Dobroniak to comically fall down to the outside again.
