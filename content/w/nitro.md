## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013)

Nitro made his debut on Polish soil in August 2013 at the [eight official show](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) produced by [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md). He teamed up with [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) against [Dover](@/w/dover.md) and [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015)

After DDW rebranded into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Nitro made a single appearance at their first official show - [KPW vs the World: Hung(a)ry for Kombat](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), where he faced [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) in a KPW vs Hungary Nations Cup Round 4 Falls Count Anywhere Match. He lost his match against the Polish villain.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut and early apperances

Thanks to his previous association with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), Tamas Szabo returned to Poland after nearly six years, in December 2021 at [PTW Underground 1](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md), where he faced and was defeated by babyface [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). He returned at [Underground 3](@/e/ptw/2022-03-27-ptw-underground-3.md) to face - and lose to - [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md). During that time he worked as a tweener.

#### Budapest Bastards and PTW Tag Team Championship

At [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) Nitro faced Axel Fox and his tag team partner [Jonny Storm](@/w/jonny-storm.md) in a Tag Team Match, where the winner would become #1 Contender for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). Teaming with [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md), Nitro managed to defeat Fox and Storm. They faced the reigning champions - PAKA - at [PTW x RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md), but due to an outside intervention by Legia Łysych, their match was ruled a no contest.

Budapest Bastards managed to secure another opportunity to fight for the PTW Tag Team Championship at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), where they scored victories against PAKA, Sinister Kingdom and MxM Collection, becoming the second PTW Tag Team Champions in history. Their reign lasted 308 days, and included victories over teams such as Axel Fox & [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), Lucha Squad and Gulyas Bros. Their reign came to an end at [PTW Underground 25: Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), where they were defeated by L'Orda.

After their loss Nitro and his tag team partner seemingly bid farewell to [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), claiming that it might be uncertain when - if ever - they return.
