## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2015-2023)

#### Backyard era

Rob Scaffold was one of the original wrestlers who joined [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) in their backyard era. His first registered appearance took place during [PpW Ropeless](@/e/ppw/2015-05-01-ppw-ropeless.md) in May 2015. During his early years he was known as Rob Hardy - a persona greatly inspired by Jeff Hardy. From October 2015 he made most of his official apperances as Rob Scaffold, but he also performed as a masked persona, Automatico, when he won the PpW Light Heavyweight Championship. He also won the PpW Tag Team Championship while teaming with Black Orion, an alter ego of [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) - as "2 Chamy" (roughly _2 Jerks_). 

#### Professional PpW Era

Rob Scaffold appeared at the first PpW show open to general public - [2KO≈ÅA To My Nie Zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md) - where he faced [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) under his official ringname, as well as against [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), where he performed as "Terry Shadow", taking a shoot at the MZW owner [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md). After PpW returned following the COVID-19 pandemic break with [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md), Scaffold made a few more apperances throughout 2021 and 2022 up until 2023. The last match in career took place at [PpW Back To The OG](@/e/ppw/2023-02-04-ppw-back-to-the-og.md), where he was defeated by Johnny Blade.

Some time later Rob Scaffold left PpW over personal dispute with some other performers in the federation and subsequently retired from pro wrestling.

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2016-2018)

Rob Scaffold appeared in [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) at [Tournament of Dreams II](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md) where he teamed up with [Norris](@/w/isnorr.md) against [Pain Killer](@/w/pain-killer.md) and [Malmo Buruto](@/w/malmo-buruto.md). In 2017 he started making rather regular apperances there and even competed for the [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md) against Norris at the final DFW show - [Crosswords City 2](@/e/dfw/2018-06-09-dfw-crosswords-city-2.md).
