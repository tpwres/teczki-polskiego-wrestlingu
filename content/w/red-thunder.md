## Professional wrestling career

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2011-2013)

Sirreks made his debut in the Głuchołazy-based backyard federation [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) during their first-ever official show [PXW Revolution 2011](@/e/pxw/2011-05-22-pxw-revolution-2011.md). He made at least 15 appearances for the group, between 2011 and 2013.

Little information is available from that time, however it is confirmed that during his PXW days he won the PXW Tag Team Championship with [Snake](@/w/snake.md), and most probably won the PXW Championship on at least one occasion. Sirreks ended his career in PXW some time in mid-to-late 2013.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2018)

#### As Kowboj Luke

In 2014 Sirreks joined the newly-formed MZW, wrestling in a cowboy gimmick under the name Kowboj Luke (_Cowboy Luke_). He was one of the first trainees of the MZW Academy who managed to score his debut at the first official MZW showcase, [Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/mzw/2014-05-10-mzw-pokaz-adeptow.md) in May 2014. As Kowboj Luke he managed to make the total of five appearances, winning in only one match - against [Szymon Siwiec](@/w/szymon-siwiec.md) at [Wrestlefans Party](@/e/mzw/2014-10-25-mzw-wrestlefans-party.md).

#### As Red Thunder

In early 2015, Kowboj Luke changed his gimmick to Red Thunder, a villainous luchador clad in red. This change improved his position on the card, and he began to win some of his matches, even against established wrestlers such as [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md). In 2016 briefly became involved in a feud with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) after he attacked him backstage at [MZW @ Wyciskanie Sztangi 2016](@/e/mzw/2016-03-12-mzw-wyciskanie-sztangi-2016.md). Red Thunder briefly aligned himself with [Kripto](@/w/kripto.md) trying to win the [MZW Tag Team Chmapionship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) in a match against [Zbójnicy](@/tt/zbojnicy.md) (Jędruś Bułecka & [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). They were, however, defeated.

Shortly thereafter, Red Thunder aligned himself with a mysterious manager - Columbus - and a new wrestler called [Blue Thunder](@/w/blue-thunder.md), forming a tag team called [Storm Riders](@/tt/storm-riders.md). They managed to win [MZW Tag Team Championship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) from [Zbójnicy](@/tt/zbojnicy.md) in January 2017 at [Charity Show](@/e/mzw/2017-01-15-mzw-charity-show-2017.md). Their reign lasted 140 days before they were defeated by [Catch Connection](@/tt/catch-connection.md) at [Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md). After that, Storm Riders disbanded and Red Thunder managed to make one last appearance at [Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md) in January 2018, before retiring from wrestling.
