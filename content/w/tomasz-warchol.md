## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2019)

Tomasz Warchoł was a pro wrestling enthusiast, who the joined newly-created [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in 2014, as it began to form. He started out as a commentator, making his debut at the first public MZW show, [Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/mzw/2014-05-10-mzw-pokaz-adeptow.md). From [Wyciskanie Sztangi](@/e/mzw/2015-03-15-mzw-wyciskanie-sztangi.md) onwards, he filled in the gap once Filip Cieśliński's appearances became very sporadic.

Since then, Tomasz Warchoł became the main host and ring announcer for most MZW shows. He became known for wearing a ship captain's suit as his ring attire for some of the shows, as well as for his distinct style of announcing. On a few occasions, he also did the double duty serving as an assisstant referee, most notably during [Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md).

Tomasz Warchoł officially retired from his ring announcing role at [MZW Project 5: Hero](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md). Afterwards, his role was taken over by [Mateusz Czarnecki](@/w/mateusz-czarnecki.md) and later by [Adrian Zgórski](@/w/adrian-zgorski.md).

### Retirement (2019-2024)

Tomasz Warchoł didn't appear in any role in MZW or any other federation. However, he was still partialy active on social media during his break from wrestling, often engaging in conversations regarding the Polish wrestling scene.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

Tomasz made a one-off appearance at [MZW No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) after nearly five years of absence. He hosted a contest where fans could win MZW T-shirts and other merchandise.
