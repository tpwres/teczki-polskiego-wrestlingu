## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2019)

Tomasz Warchoł was a pro wrestling enthusiast, who the joined newly-created [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in 2014, as it began to form. He started out as a commentator, making his debut at the first public MZW show, [Pokaz Adeptów](@/e/mzw/2014-05-10-mzw-pokaz-adeptow.md). From [Wyciskanie Sztangi](@/e/mzw/2015-03-15-mzw-wyciskanie-sztangi.md) onwards, he filled in the gap once Filip Cieśliński's appearances became very sporadic.

He became known for wearing a ship captain's suit as his ring attire for some of the shows, as well as for his distinct style of announcing. On a few occasions, he also did the double duty serving as an assisstant referee, most notably during [Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md).

Tomasz Warchoł officially retired from his ring announcing role at [MZW Project 5: Hero](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md). Afterwards, his role was taken over by [Mateusz Czarnecki](@/w/mateusz-czarnecki.md) and later by Adrian Zgórski.
