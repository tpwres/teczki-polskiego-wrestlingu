## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-present)

#### Alexander Reich & Catch Connection

Alexander Reich made his debut for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in May 2015 at [Champions War](@/e/mzw/2015-05-31-mzw-champions-war.md), as a member of Catch Connection, along with [Ronny Kessler](@/w/ronny-kessler.md).
His appearances for MZW were possible thanks to good working relations between the Polish federation and the German wrestling scene, mostly Dresden-based organizations like Next Step Wrestling.

At [Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md) Catch Connection defeated [Zbójnicy](@/tt/zbojnicy.md) to win the [MZW Tag Team Championship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md), becoming the third champions in the history of the title.
Their reign lasted up until [Project 1](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) in 2018, when they were defeated by Wataha ([Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) & [Apollo Anderson](@/w/apollo-anderson.md)), ending their championship reign after 497 days.

#### Alex Ace

After his defeat in the Tag Team Championship Match, Alexander Reich vanished from MZW.
This hiatus lasted until 2023, when he returned to the Wrocław-based federation as Alex Ace at [Game ON](@/e/mzw/2023-03-11-mzw-game-on.md), losing to Leo Zayde in a Triple Threat Match.
At [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) he returned once more, as the ERW East Division Champion, and defended his title against [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), managing to emerge victorious in a controversial fashion after hitting [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) with his championship belt.
