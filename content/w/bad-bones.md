## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2024)

#### Debut at BlackOut

John Klinger made his debut in Poland working for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). In his debut match at [BlackOut](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md) he faced ex-WWE superstar and reigning GWF Champion Axel Tischer in a unsuccessful bout for the Championship.

#### Feud with PAKA

Later on Bad Bones, portraying a villain, got involved in a feud against PTW's babyface stable PAKA. He was accused of attacking and seriously injuring [Taras](@/w/taras.md) after a training session at [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md).
At [Underground 4](@/e/ptw/2022-04-24-ptw-underground-4.md) he defeated [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), and later [Boro](@/w/boro.md) at [Underground 6](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md). 
During his feud with PAKA, he got embroiled in numerous altercations against PTW's owner and promoter [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), who constantly threatened him with a suspension.
Bad Bones finally finished PAKA in a match against Taras, which took place at [RyuCon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md).

#### Feud with Pawłowski

After a match against [Samson](@/w/samson.md) at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md) Bad Bones assaulted the Polish wrestler with a baseball bat, which resulted in Pawłowski finally releasing him.
The furious Bones got his revenge during [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), where he tried to enter the ring to attack [Santino](@/w/santino.md), but was quickly escorted out by security.
At [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) Bad Bones appeared on-screen when Pawłowski was closing the show. Klinger requested Pawłowski to reinstate him, and to give him a title match.
When Pawłowski declined, the screen revealed a chair with a tied-down Marcin "Rzeźnik" Rzeźniczek, the co-owner of PTW. Klinger beat up Rzeźniczek and threatened to cut off his fingers with pliers.
This convinced Pawłowski to reinstate Klinger. On-screen, Klinger laid out Rzeźniczek with a punch, then carried him, stunned and still tied up, to the entrance stage. Pawłowski sent the security team after them, and they managed to chase Bones away.

During [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) in February 2024, when seemingly everyone forgot about Bones, he appeared on-screen during the Gold Rush Rumble Match to remind Pawłowski about the promised title match.
Later in the show, during Pawłowski's proposal to his girlfriend, he was interrupted by [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) who showed Pawłowski the full footage of Rzeźniczak's kidnapping from The Mystery, and revealing it was an elaborate ruse by Bones, Rzeżniczek and Longman, all of whom were scheming against Pawłowski.

At [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) on May 11th, 2024, John Klinger made his last appearance for PTW, where he faced and defeated British wrestler Flash Morgan Webster.

This marked Bad Bones's final appearance for PTW. Not long after, on May 20th, John "Bad Bones" Klinger passed away at the age of 40. His death was mourned by numerous promotions and wrestlers around the world, including many PTW wrestlers and staff members, who had the opportunity to meet and work with him.
