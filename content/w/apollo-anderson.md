## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2017-2019; 2025-present)

#### Apollo Anderson

Apollo Anderson made his debut for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in December 2017 at [Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md), working with [Bartosz Borowsky](@/w/boro.md) in a Tag Team Match against [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) and [Rick Baxxter](@/w/rick-baxxter.md). He also fought in a Ten-Man Battle Royal Match at the same show. From the start he distinguished himself from other wrestlers thanks to his agility and musculature.

During the "Project Era" he started a Tag Team called "Wataha", in which he teamed up with [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md). At [Project 1](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) they won the [MZW Tag Team Championships](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) from Catch Connection ([Alexander Reich](@/w/alex-ace.md) and [Ronny Kessler](@/w/ronny-kessler.md)). As champions, they never defended their title as the atmosphere in their team quickly began to sour.
Wataha officially broke up at [Project 4](@/e/mzw/2019-03-23-mzw-project-4-open-your-eyes.md) with Apollo turning heel on Justin. Soon after [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), acting as the authority figure, stripped Apollo of his Tag Team Championship, retiring the title. Apollo's last match took place at [Project 5](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md), where he defeated [Dynamite Dave](@/w/dynamite-dave.md). Soon after that show, Apollo's career went on hiatus due to personal reasons.

#### Return as The Wolf

Apollo made his re-debut as "The Wolf" at [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md), where he lost to [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md).
