## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2017-2019; 2025-present)

#### Apollo Anderson

Apollo Anderson made his debut for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) in December 2017 at [Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md), working with [Bartosz Borowsky](@/w/boro.md) in a Tag Team Match against [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) and [Rick Baxxter](@/w/rick-baxxter.md). He also fought in a Ten-Man Battle Royal Match at the same show. From the start he distinguished himself from other wrestlers thanks to his agility and musculature.

During the "Project Era" he started a Tag Team called "Wataha", in which he teamed up with [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md). At [Project 1](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) they won the [MZW Tag Team Championships](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) from Catch Connection ([Alexander Reich](@/w/alex-ace.md) and [Ronny Kessler](@/w/ronny-kessler.md)). As champions, they never defended their title as the atmosphere in their team quickly began to sour.
Wataha officially broke up at [Project 4](@/e/mzw/2019-03-23-mzw-project-4-open-your-eyes.md) with Apollo turning heel on Justin. Soon after [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), acting as the authority figure, stripped Apollo of his Tag Team Championship, retiring the title. Apollo's last match took place at [Project 5](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md), where he defeated [Dynamite Dave](@/w/dynamite-dave.md). Soon after that show, Apollo's career went on hiatus due to personal reasons.

#### Return as The Wolf

Apollo made his re-debut as "The Wolf" at [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md), where he lost to [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md). Beginning with [MZW Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md), he started going by Febus 'The Wolf'.

## International wrestling appearances

Between 2017 and 2019 Apollo Anderson made a few international appearances. In 2017 he worked one match for Pro Wrestling Magyarország in Hungary, and another one for Next Step Wrestling in 2019. He was scheduled to work for Czech federation VcV in 2019, but due to personal reasons his career was halted.
