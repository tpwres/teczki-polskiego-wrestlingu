## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Mira started her pro wrestling career in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), debuting in 2013.
Along with [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) and [Kasandra](@/w/kasandra.md) she was one of the first ever Polish female wrestlers to make an official in-ring debut.
Mira made her first appearance at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) show in August 2013, where she faced Bianca.
For the rest of her tenure in DDW - due to a shortage of female opponents - she fought mostly exhibition matches against [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) and [Kasandra](@/w/kasandra.md) in various configurations, only once appearing alongside Hungarian wrestler Audrey Bride against Bianca and [Aurora](@/w/kasandra.md).

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

After DDW folded its operations and transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Mira joined the new federation along with many ex-DDW talents.
She was quickly paired with [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) as his manager and sporadic partner in mixed tag team matches.
She adapted a babyface persona of Ostrowski's main dancer, being visible during his entrances. Her signature look included a pair of "disco sneakers" decorated with colorful LEDs that changed colors with every step.

Some time later she was joined by her kayfabe-sister [Alisa](@/w/alisa.md).
The sisters' relationship grew more and more bitter, finally culminating at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), when Alisa turned heel on her sister and Ostrowski by joining the villainous faction Kawaleria, led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md).
After that Mira spent almost a year feuding with her sister which concluded at [KPW Arena X: Kawaleria vs Sojusz](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md), where Mira represented the babyface faction Sojusz, and Alisa the villanous Kawaleria. Mira was defeated by her sister, and fought only one more match before returning to her managerial role alongside Boski Ostrowski.

In January 2019, she danced into the ring for the final time at [KPW Arena 12: Gwiazda Północy](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12.md), where she announced that due to pregnancy, she had to take a hiatus from in-ring competition. However, she never made her return, as she left KPW in April 2021.

Since then, Mira is still active in the wrestling industry as a ring-gear tailor and designer, working with multiple wrestlers on the Polish and international wrestling scenes.
