## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

Mira started her pro wrestling career training and debuting in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md). Among with [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) and Kasandra she was one of the first Polish female wrestlers who made their official in-ring debut. Mira made her first apperance at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) show in August 2013, where she faced Bianca. For the rest of her tenure in DDW - due to shortage of female wrestlers - she fought mostly exhibition matches against Bianca and Kasandra (also known as Aurora) in various configurations, with only sporadic occasion where she fought alongside Audrey Bride against Bianca and Aurora.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

After DDW folded its operations and got transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) Mira joined the federation along with many ex-DDW talents. She was quickly paired with [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) as his manager and sporadic partner in mixed tag team matches. She adapted a babyface persona of Ostrowski's main dancer, being visible when he was making his entrances. 

Sometime later she was joined by her keyfabe-sister [Alisa](@/w/alisa.md). Sister relationship grew bitter before [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), as Alisa turned heel on her sister and Ostrowski, by joining villainous faction led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md): Kawaleria. After that Mira spent almost a year on feuding with her sister which concluded at [KPW Arena X: Kawaleria vs Sojusz](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md), where Mira was representing Sojusz, and Alisa Kawaleria factions. Mira was defeated by her sister, and later on fought only one more match before returining to her managerial role alongside Boski Ostrowski.

In January 2019 he made her last on-screen apperance at [KPW Arena 12: Gwiazda Północy](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12-gwiazda-polnocy.md), where she announced that due to her pregnancy she would have to put her career on a hiatus. However, she never made her in-ring return, as she left KPW in April 2021. 

From that point on she is still active in wrestling industry as a ring-gear tailor and designer, working with many wrestlers on Polish and foregin wrestling scene.
