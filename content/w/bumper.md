## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Debut and early appearances

Bumper first appeared as a rookie at [All About the Moné](@/e/ptw/2025-07-27-ptw-all-about-the-mone.md), alongside rookies Dropper and [Boguś](@/w/bogus.md) in a Handicap Match against [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) for the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) and the BestYa Championship. He later made his official debut at [Halloweenowa Rozpierducha](@/e/ptw/2025-10-25-ptw-halloweenowa-rozpierducha.md). He portrayed a cocky persona of overconfident rookie, which colided with his abilities to win a match against wrestlers such as [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md). This led to him alligning himself with fellow rookie called Dropper to form "Bump & Drop" Tag Team known for their lack of in-ring chemistry, which led to another series of defeats.
