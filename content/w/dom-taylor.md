At [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md) Taylor teamed up with his partner [Lee Rogers](@/w/lee-rogers.md) as the British Bouncer Club, to take part in a tournament for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). The team advanced to the the semi-finals by defeating [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md) and [Mateusz Kakareko](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md), but were ultimately defeated by Boska Oliwa ([David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) and [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md)).
