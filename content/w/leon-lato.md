Leon Lato is a high flyer working for [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). He made his in-ring debut in 2022 on the first day of [Tattoo Konwent](@/e/kpw/2022-07-30-kpw-tattoo-konwent-2022-day1.md) and within the next two years he quickly worked his way up to fighting for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) as well as the [KPW OldTown](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) titles.

Lato usually works solo, although on a couple of occasions he formed a tag team with another high flyer, [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md).
