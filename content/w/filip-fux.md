## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2018-present)

#### Debut and KPW Tag Team Champions

Filip Fux is one half of the Fux Brothers tag team, along with his kayfabe sibling [Michał](@/w/michal-fux.md). Filip started training in the [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) school in January 2018 and made his in-ring debut at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md). He's best known for his tag team work alongside Michał, but he's also had a number of solo matches.
The Fux Brothers won their [KPW Tag Team Champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) from Die Ordnung ([Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) & [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md)) at [Godzina Zero 2023](2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) and held them for two years, before losing it at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md) to [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md) ([David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) & [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md)).

#### Solo championship pursuits

In November 2024 [Krystian Maliowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md), the chairman of KPW, announced that at [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) Filip Fux would be one of the contestants in "The Race" for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md). Filip managed to win his qualifier match against [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md). At [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md) he entered the final match facing [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) and his brother Michał in a Triple Threat Match. He was unable to secure a victory, as the match was won by Michał Fux.

After his defeat at Arena 27 Filip challenged [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) for his [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md). During the build-up for [Arena 28](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) it was officially announced that the match would be a Street Fight Match. However, Filip was defeated by the reigning champion. At [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) the Fux Brothers were challenged by [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md) for their [KPW Tag Team Championships](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). Shockingly, the challangers were able to defeat the Champions, ending their reign after 735 days.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Feud with Legia Łysych

Filip Fux was the first KPW wrestler to be announced as the member of [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) roster, thus becoming the first worker KPW allowed to perform in another Polish federation. A few months before the [inaugural Legacy of Wrestling show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) Filip got involved in a feud with his old friend from [KPW Wrestling School](@/o/szkola-kpw.md) and a member of [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md): [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md). In one of the episodes of Marco's YouTube vlog series "Łysy Vlog" (_Bald Vlog_) he got into an argument with Filip over some muscle-enhancing creatine, which Filip supposedly stole from Marco during their joint trip to Hungary for an HCW show. This Internet feud evolved into a match at Legacy's first show. Marco won this match after a distraction by [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and, in a post-match beatdown, him and Olgierd managed to snatch Filip's [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) belt and pose with it, which strongly suggested Legia's intention to face the KPW Champions for their titles.

The Fux Brothers versus Legia Łysych Match eventually happened at [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md). Despite multiple shenanigans pulled off by Legia Łysych, Filip and Michał emerged victorious from their title defence against Legia Łysych. At Legacy's [third show](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) Filip unsucessfully challenged [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) in a Road to the Title Triple Threat Match.

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2026-present)

#### Debut and joining Rodzina

Just two days before the show, Filip Fux was announced for a pre-show match at [PpW Jednak Hardcore](@/e/ppw/2026-01-31-ppw-jednak-hardcore.md), going against [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md) from [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). This marked the first time an active KPW wrestler stepped into the PpW ring. Filip emerged victorious, and later on intervened in a match between [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) by attacking Gryffin with a steel chair shot to the back of the head. It was quickly revealed that he did it at the order of [Rodzina](@/tt/rodzina.md) - a villainous stable he'd joined. Unlike in KPW and Legacy, where he's a clear-cut babyface, in PpW he portrays a heel character.

## International wrestling appearances 

From 2023 onwards Filip started to secure international bookings for himself. He managed to made a few appearances for European Wrestling Association, Passion Pro and in SLAM Wrestling Entertainment.
