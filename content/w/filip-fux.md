Filip Fux is one half of the Fux Brothers tag team, along with his kayfabe sibling [Michał](@/w/michal-fux.md). Filip started training in the [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) school in January 2018 and made his in-ring debut at [KPW Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md). He's best known for his tag team work alongside Michał, but he's also had a number of solo matches.

The Fux Brothers are the reigning [KPW Tag Team Champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md), having won the belts from Die Ordnung ([Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) & [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md)) at [KPW Godzina Zero 2023](2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md). In 2023 they also made an appearance at an European Wrestling Association show in Austria. 

Filip Fux was the first KPW wrestler to be booked for the [inaugural Legacy of Wrestling show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), thus becoming the first worker KPW allowed to perform in another Polish federation.
