## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2021)

Konrad von Koch is one of the first trainees on the history of [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md). However, he never made an in-ring debut. Instead he became the kayfabe "host" of [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) during the [MZW Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md) shows taped during the COVID-19 pandemic. In those shows, he set up a tournament for the Project Basement Trophy and was involved in numerous angles. After Project Basement ended, he was not used as an on-screen personality and subsequently retired from the wrestling business.
