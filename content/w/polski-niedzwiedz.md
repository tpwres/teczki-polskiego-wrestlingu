## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Debut and losing streak

In late December 2024 Polish Bear started publishing a series of vignettes teasing his in-ring debut for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). It eventually concluded at [Wiosenna Bijatyka](@/e/ptw/2025-03-15-ptw-wiosenna-bijatyka.md) where he debuted in a Singles Match against [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md). He was however quickly squashed by the reigning [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md). The next highlight of his career came when he intervened in a brawl between [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) and [Serg Sullivan](@/w/serg-sullivan.md), but was famously knocked out by Sullivan. This resuled in a brief feud between the two that ended at [Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md) with Serg's victory. From that point on, Bear worked mostly as enhancement talent for PTW, amassing a streak of defeats.

#### Synowie Lasu

At [Świąt Nie Będzie](@/e/ptw/2025-12-13-ptw-swiat-nie-bedzie.md) Polski Niedźwiedź finally managed to break his losing streak by defeating Baron Wolfgang Storm. In a post-match promo he announced that following the New Year he would come back with a companion. The identy of his partner was revealed at [Odrodzenie](@/e/ptw/2026-01-31-ptw-odrodzenie.md), where he formed a Tag Team with debuting Misiek - another wrestler portraying a bear character. The team named "Synowie Lasu" (_Sons of the Forest_) began their cooperation by defeating the team of Dropper & [Bumper](@/w/bumper.md).

## International wrestling career
