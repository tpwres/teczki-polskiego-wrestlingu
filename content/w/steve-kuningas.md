## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2022-2024)

Steve Kuningas made his debut at [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md) where he was defeated by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md). From that moment, he started making regular appearances at every single PpW's show. Fairly quickly, he entered the championship picture when he faced [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) in a Ladder Match for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) at [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) and in a Hardcore Triple Threat Match for said championship at [Back to the OG](@/e/ppw/2023-02-04-ppw-back-to-the-og.md). His championship pursuit came to an end at [Ledwo Legalne III](@/e/ppw/2023-06-17-ppw-ledwo-legalne-3.md) where he finally defeated Biesiad for the PpW Championship.

Steve's reign lasted 238 days, but during that time he did not make any official championship defenses. He only participated in one tag team match at [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md). His first - and last - championship defense came up at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) where he lost to [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md). After that he made no further appearances in PpW.

Besides his appearances in Poland, he also makes numerous appearances on the European independent scene.
