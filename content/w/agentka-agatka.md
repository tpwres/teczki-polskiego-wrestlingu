## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Managing Oskar Alexander

Agentka Agatka made her debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), during [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) where she joined _rookie_ Oskar after his post-match victorious promo, when he named himself as [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md).
She was portrayed as an independent girlboss who is running a "talent agency" managing prospecting wrestlers, such as Oskar himself.
From her debut onwards she started making rather regular appearances by Oskar's side, often helping him gain advantage by any means necessary.
She was also responsible for setting him up in matches against PpW's top performers, such as [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) or The Legend [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), thanks to her ability to cut good deals with PpW's producer [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md).

During the 20 Typa 20 Broni Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) she was at Oskar's side during his entrance. When it turned out that she hadn't prepared a weapon for Oskar, she was used as a weapon herself, delivering multiple groin kicks to Oskar's opponents.

#### In-ring debut

During the build-up to [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), PpW announced that the show would see the first ever women's match in PpW's history.
Initially, the organization only revealed that Danish wrestler Madison Marley would face an unnamed Ewenement Dojo-trained wrestler.
Later on Agatka posted a video of her calling Mister Z on the phone. She voiced her displeasure in Madison Marley getting booked, as it undermined her position as the sole woman in PpW. Agatka devised a plan to get rid of Marley. That match saw Madison pitted against Agatka indeed, who then won her debut match via roll-up after Oskar's interference.
