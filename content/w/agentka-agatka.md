## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Managing Oskar Aleksander

Agentka Agatka made her debiut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), after being trained in [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md), during [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) where she joined _rookie_ Oskar after his post-match victorious promo, when he named himself as [Oskar Aleksander](@/w/oskar-aleksander.md). She was portrayed as an independent girlboss who is running a "talent agency" managing prospecting wrestlers, such as Oskar himself. From her debiut onwards she started making rather regular appearances by Oskar's side, often helping him gain advantage in his matches, or even setting him up for matches against PpW's top performers, such as [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) or The Legend [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - thanks to her ability to cut good deals with PpW's producer [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md). 

During the 20 Typa 20 Broni Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](content/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) she was at Oskar's side during his entrance to the match. When it was revealed that she hadn't prepared any weapon for Oskar, she was used as a weapon herself, delivering multiple groin kicks to Oskar's opponents. 

#### In-ring debut

During the build-up to [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) it was announced that the show would see the first ever women's match in PpW's history. Initially, only the fact that Danish wrestler Madison Marley would face an unnamed Ewenement Dojo-trained wrestler was announced. Later on Agatka posted a video of her call with Mister Z. She voiced her displeasure in Madison Marley getting booked, as it undermined her position as the sole woman in PpW. She made a plan to get rid of Marley. During the show itself she entered the competition against Madison, winning her debut match via roll-up after Oskar's interference.
