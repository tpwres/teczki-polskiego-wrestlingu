## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2024-present)

#### Managing Oskar Alexander

Agentka Agatka made her debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) during [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), where she joined rookie Oskar after his post-match victorious promo in which he named himself [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md).
She was portrayed as an independent girlboss who is running a "talent agency" managing prospecting wrestlers, such as Oskar himself. 
From her debut onwards she started making rather regular appearances by Oskar's side, often helping him gain advantage by any means necessary. Around that time, she and Oskar were often mentioned as "Agencja" (_The Agency_) - with Agatka being the manager of Oskar during many of his matches.
She was also responsible for setting him up in matches against PpW's top performers, such as [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) or The Legend [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), thanks to her ability to cut good deals with PpW's producer, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md).

During the 20 Typa 20 Broni Match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) she was at Oskar's side during his entrance. When it turned out that she hadn't prepared a weapon for Oskar, she was used as a weapon herself, delivering multiple groin kicks to Oskar's opponents.

#### In-ring debut

During the build-up to [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), PpW announced that the show would see the first ever women's match in PpW's history.
Initially, the organization only revealed that Danish wrestler Madison Marley would face an unnamed [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md)-trained wrestler.
Later on Agatka posted a video of her calling Mister Z on the phone. She voiced her displeasure in Madison Marley getting booked, as it undermined her position as the sole woman in PpW. Agatka devised a plan to get rid of Marley. That match saw Madison pitted against Agatka, who then won her debut match via roll-up after Oskar's interference. From that point on she also started irregulary teaming-up with Oskar as Agencja (eg. in their match at [Mystic Festival](@/e/ppw/2025-06-04-ppw-mystic-more-brutal-than-metal.md). They also managed each other during their singles matches.

#### Joining Rodzina

After Oskar's interference in [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) vs [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) it was revealed that both Oskar and Agentka Agatka would join the legend of Polish wrestling to form new stable called "Rodzina" (_The Family_), with Vic presented as "The Patriarch". Agencja (_The Agency_) was then incorporated into Rodzina as part-time tag team/partnership of Oskar and Agatka, with them still having each other's backs; for example, during the Gauntlet Match at [Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-07-05-ppw-turniej-typeshit.md) Agatka helped Oskar to secure a win over [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), herself having been defeated by [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) a couple of matches prior.

After Oskar was defeated by Gabriel Queen in the second round of [Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md), he got into conflict with [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) by disrespecting him. Dobroniak wanted to teach Oskar a lesson by facing his "mother" Agatka in a Custodity of Oskar Match at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md). This match however quickly evolved into a Tornado Tag Team Match between Agencja and Stanisław & [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). Thanks to the intervention of newest Rodzina member - [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) - they managed to score a victory. Later that night Agatka and Oskar also intervened in both Robert and Vic's matches to help them achieve victory, but they were unsucessful on both occasions.
