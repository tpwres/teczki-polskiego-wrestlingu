## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2022-present)

Darius made his debut in Poland working for Gdynia-based promotion [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). For most of his career he worked as a babyface, positioning himself mostly in midcard. He made his first appearance at [Arena 18](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md) in March 2022, where he took part in a Triple Threat Match against [Red Scorpion](@/w/red-scorpion.md) and [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md). 

At [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) he won a Four-Way Match to determine #1 Contender for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md). He cashed in his contract at [Arena 20](@/e/kpw/2022-12-16-kpw-arena-20.md) against the reigning champion [Rostetti](@/w/rosetti.md), but Rosetti declined to defend his title, reportedly due to poor health. When the bell rang, Rosetti immediately exited the ring and was counted out, which allowed him to keep the Championship. Darius had his rematch at [Arena 24](@/e/kpw/2024-02-16-kpw-arena-24.md), but this time Rosetti managed to defeat him by pinfall.
