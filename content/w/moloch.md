## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2018-2019)

Moloch debuted in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in May 2018 after training in its academy. Prior to his debut KPW teased his debut in a series of mysterious dark-themed vignettes. He debuted as villainous mask wearing monster. In his debut fight he defeated [Boski Osrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) at [KPW Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x-kawaleria-vs-sojusz.md). 

Later on, he unsucessfully took part in Magnificent Seven Ladder Match at [KPW Godzina Zero 2018](@/e/kpw/2018-08-11-kpw-godzina-zero-2018.md). He was also trying to take part in a tournament for [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) along with [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md). However, shortly before the show Gracjan treasoned Moloch by pulling off from the tournament, forcing Moloch to fight against Kawaleria in a Handicap Match. He lost that match. 

After these two defeats Moloch got on a winning streak, scoring numerous victories against performers such as [Mateusz Kakareko](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md), [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), Gracjan Korpo and Crowdchester. This allowed him to challenge [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) for [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) at [KPW Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md). Moloch got defeated by champion, and this match was seemingly the last one in Moloch's career, as he retired from professional wrestling, ending his career after little over a year.
