## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2018-2019)

Moloch debuted in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in May 2018, after training in their academy.
Prior to his debut, KPW teased his appearance in a series of mysterious horror-themed vignettes, notably featuring two female valets in tight catsuits, who were later present at ringside during his matches. He debuted as a villainous mask-wearing monster. In his debut match he defeated [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) at [KPW Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md).

Later on, he unsuccessfully took part in the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match at [KPW Godzina Zero 2018](@/e/kpw/2018-08-11-kpw-godzina-zero-2018.md).
Moloch also entered in a tournament for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) along with [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md). However, shortly before the show Gracjan betrayed Moloch by pulling out from the tournament, forcing him to fight against Kawaleria in a Handicap Match, which he lost.

After these two defeats, Moloch launched into a winning streak, scoring numerous victories against performers such as [Mateusz Kakareko](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md), [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), Gracjan Korpo and Crowchester. This allowed him to challenge [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) for the [OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md). Moloch was defeated by the champion, and this match was the last one in Moloch's career, as he retired from professional wrestling ending his career after just over a year.
