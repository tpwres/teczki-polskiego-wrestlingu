## Professional wrestling career

### Early years

According to Chris, he was introduced to professional wrestling around 2008, watching a clip of Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton. This piqued his interest, and he started to follow wrestling. Not long afterwards, he bought the videogame _Smackdown vs Raw 2008_, where he learned about wrestling moves and finishers.
Chris discovered the Polish backyard wrestling scene through a newspaper, reading about [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md) in the weekly magazine "Angora". He read about them in an article titled "Hulk Hogan's successors from Wołów", published in 2011.

### Toruń Wrestling Federation (2011-2014)

Chris first started wrestling in [Toruń Wrestling Federation](@/o/twf.md), which he co-founded with his real-life brother [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md) (AKA "Hero"). He worked over 20 matches under the ring name "Monster" and won the TWF Championship and the Toruń Championship.

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2012)

In July 2012 Monster made an appearance for Głuchołazy-based federation [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) at their supercard show [Backyardmania III](@/e/pxw/2012-07-24-pxw-backyardmania-3.md), where he faced fellow TWF wrestler [Billi Rox](@/w/corin-mear.md).

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2018)

Chris got the idea to start his own, more professional wrestling group when he was returning home from an appearance in another backyard group, EKW from Elbląg.
In an interview for MyCast, he recalls receiving a botched kick from [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md), which caused his eye to swell and temporarily restrict his vision. On a train back from Elbląg to Toruń, barely able to see, he made his decision. Chris became the group's leader, and later their inaugural champion.

Since creating [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) in 2015, he appeared at almost every single DFW show. He debuted at their [First Showcase](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md) in June 2015 where he defeated Revage, with whom he had a heated rivalry. At [Tournament of Dreams](@/e/dfw/2016-06-11-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-1.md) he advanced to the finals, to eventually be crowned the inaugural [DFW Champion](@/c/dfw-championship.md) at [Tournament of Dreams II](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md).

Hunter ran a successful campaign as a champion, defending his title against other top DFW wrestlers such as [Direk](@/w/direk.md), [Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) and [Pain Killer](@/w/pain-killer.md). He finally lost the Championship to his old rival Revage, in a match that took place at [Recent Dreams](@/e/dfw/2017-04-23-dfw-recent-dreams.md) in April 2017. Chris Hunter made his last appearance for DFW at their [Charity Show](@/e/dfw/2018-03-08-dfw-charity-gauntlet-match.md) in March 2018, where he was defeated in a Gauntlet Match, in which [Norris](@/w/isnorr.md) won the vacated DFW Championship.

Since then Chris retired from wrestling, closing down Dream Factory Wrestling not long after [Crosswords City II](@/e/dfw/2018-06-09-dfw-crosswords-city-2.md) in June 2018.
