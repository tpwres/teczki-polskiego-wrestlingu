Chris Hunter is a retired backyard wrestler, best known for creating and competing in [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md). He was also active in other backyard groups, such as EKW from Elbląg, TWF from Toruń, and [PXW](@/o/pxw.md).

## Early years

According to Chris, he was introduced to wrestling arout 2008, watching a clip of Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton. This piqued his interest, and he started to follow wrestling. Not long afterwards he bought the videogame Smackdown vs Raw 2008, which is where he learned about wrestling moves and finishers. Chris discovered the Polish backyard wrestling scene through a newspaper, reading about [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md) in the weekly magazine "Angora". He read an article about "Hulk Hogan's successors from Wołów", which was published in 2011.

## Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2018)

Chris got the idea to start his own wrestling group when he was returning home from an appearance in another backyard group, EKW from Elbląg. In an interview for MyCast, he recalls receiving a botched kick from [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md), which caused his eye to swell and temporarily restrict his vision. On a train from Elbląg to Toruń, barely being able to see, he made his decision.

Chris was the group's leader, and later their inaugural champion.
