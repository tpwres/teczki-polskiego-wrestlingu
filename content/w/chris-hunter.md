## Professional wrestling career

### Early years

According to Chris, he was introduced to wrestling arout 2008, watching a clip of Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton. This piqued his interest, and he started to follow wrestling. Not long afterwards he bought the videogame Smackdown vs Raw 2008, which is where he learned about wrestling moves and finishers. Chris discovered the Polish backyard wrestling scene through a newspaper, reading about [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md) in the weekly magazine "Angora". He read an article about "Hulk Hogan's successors from Wołów", which was published in 2011.

### Polish Xtreme Wrestling (2012)

Chris Hunter - then working under his ringname "Hero" - made his appearance for Głuchołazy-based federation [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) at their supercard show [Backyardmania III](@/e/pxw/2012-07-24-pxw-backyardmania-3.md) in July 2012, where he faced a wrestler named Gangsta.

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2015-2018)

Chris got the idea to start his own wrestling group when he was returning home from an appearance in another backyard group, EKW from Elbląg. In an interview for MyCast, he recalls receiving a botched kick from [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md), which caused his eye to swell and temporarily restrict his vision. On a train from Elbląg to Toruń, barely being able to see, he made his decision. Chris was the group's leader, and later their inaugural champion.

Since creating [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) in 2015, he appeared at almost every single DFW show. He debuted at their [First Showcase](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md) in June 2015 where he defeated Revage, with whom he had a heated rivalry. At [Tournament of Dreams](@/e/dfw/2016-06-11-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-1.md) he advanced to the finals, to eventually be crowned the inaugural [DFW Champion](@/c/dfw-championship.md) at [Tournament of Dreams II](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md).

Hunter ran a successful campaign as a champion, defending his title against other top DFW wrestlers such as [Direk](@/w/direk.md), [Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) and [Pain Killer](@/w/pain-killer.md). He finally lost the Championship in a match against his old rival Revage, in a match that took place at [Recent Dreams](@/e/dfw/2017-04-23-dfw-recent-dreams.md) in April 2017. Chris Hunter made his last appearance for DFW at their [Charity Show](@/e/dfw/2018-03-08-dfw-charity-gauntlet-match.md) in March 2018 where he was defeated in a Gauntlet Match, in which [Norris](@/w/isnorr.md) won the vacated DFW Championship.

Since then Chris retired from wrestling, closing down Dream Factory Wrestling not long after [Crosswords City II](@/e/dfw/2018-06-09-dfw-crosswords-city-2.md) in June 2018.
