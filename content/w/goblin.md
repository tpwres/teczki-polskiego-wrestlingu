## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2023-present)

#### Debut and early rivalries 

Goblin made his debut in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [Ledwo Legalne III](@/e/ppw/2023-06-17-ppw-ledwo-legalne-3.md), where he faced [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md). He debuted in a babyface "Acid Messiah" gimmick, which quickly gained him a lot of positive reception from the fans thanks to his chaotic nature, psychodelic promos and fondiness of beer. At [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md) he faced - and got defeated by - Javier Vives. Despite that, he quickly gained popularity, gethering a fanbase called "Gobliniarze" (which can be roughly translated as "Goblinators").

#### Feud with Gustav Gryffin

In December 2023 at [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) Goblin faced [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) - a villainous wrestler obsessed with self-improvement - which made that a match of polar opposites. Goblin has defeated Gustav, which also marked his first official win in PpW. In the aftermath of Gustav Gryffin vs Goblin at Turbo OG, Goblin has moved on, while Gustav became obsessed with his unexpected loss. At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md), his frustration reached a critical point, leading to him attacking Goblin, stealing his prize from the 420 Critical Ladder Match. During the mid-show interviews, both wrestlers declared their plans to go for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), and to face each other. Later that night, after Gryffin's attempt to interfere in [Feager](@/w/feager.md) v [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) on the latter's behalf, Goblin disposed of Gustav, taking him out of the ring and brawling to the outside. 

This rivalry led them to facing each other in a No Holds Barred #1 Contender Match at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md). Despite this being a even fight Gustav - accompanied by [Jakub Sigmarsson](@/w/jakub-linde.md), and [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) - was able to defeat Goblin and became #1 Contender.

#### GobLis and feud with Zmowa

During the build-up to [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md) Gustav reached up to Legia Łysych member [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) offering the team a match against Acid Messiah. Additionally unless Goblin is able to find a partner, it would be a handicap match. It caused trouble for him, as his potential allies already had problems of their own - [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) (who just lost a tag match to Legia) was facing [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) challenged Gustav for the PpW Championship, and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) was defending his newly regained [European UV Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md). At the show itself Goblin stood up against Legia Łysych alone and cut a short promo, mentioning how Legia Łysych got under many people skin even before they came in to PpW in June that year, and that one of such person came to PpW to get his hands on Legia. This marked the surprise debut of [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) who teamed up with Goblin as a team quickly named by PpW fans as "GobLis". However, due to Mister Z's interference in a match they were unable to defeat Legia Łysych. 

Grudge held against members of Mister Z villainous stable - [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md) - especially against Legia Łysych caused Goblin and Fox to join a impromptu faction created by Biesiad: Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie (Collusion Against Collusion). Team of Goblin, Fox, Biesiad, Gabriel Queen and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) faced Mister Z, Jakub Linde, Olgierd, [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) in a Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md). Eventually Zmowa got upper hand, leaving Goblin alone against Mister Z, Longman and Olgierd but The Acid Messiah was able to miracleously win the match as the sole survivor. 

#### Feud with Olgierd

After Olgierd's humaliating defeat in Ustawka Match at Co Za Noc he held grudge against Goblin. In a post-show interview he vowed to destroy Goblin and make him "his bitch". Goblin responded by publishing a promo, in which he likened it to a fictional scenario where Władysław Jagiełło and Ulrich von Jungingen face off for the [Battle of Grunwald][bitwa-pod-grunwaldem], only to be met with Genghis Khan interfering - in this case, the "stupid Mongolian" would be Olgierd. He dared Olgierd to make good on his promises to "end" Goblin. 

At [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) Goblin was able to defend himself against [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) and [Feager](@/w/feager.md) in a Monar Gauntlet Match. Later that night he intervened in Six-Man Tag Team Match of Mister Z and Legia Łysych against Axel Fox and The Hardcores. He attacked Olgierd and dragged him out of arena on a dog leash. At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) the similar situation repeated itself, when Goblin attakced Olgierd, put him in a dog collar and chained him to the turnbuckle. This build-up led to their match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md), with the stipulation being Dog Collar Match - the first one in Polish wrestling history. Goblin however was defeated by hooligan from Legia Łysych.

#### The Last Dance 

Goblin returned to the ring the same night he was almost hanged by Olgierd to enter 20 Typa 20 Broni Match and become #1 Contender for the PpW Championship at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md). Acid Messiah did that by eliminating his Tag Team partner and friend Axel Fox. After his victory reigning champion - and Goblin's old rival - Gustav Gryffin came out and faced new #1 Contender. The match was at Ledwo Legalne 5 was dubbed "The Last Dance" due to it being the third official match between Goblin and Gustav.
