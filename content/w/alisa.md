## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2017-2021)

Alisa made her debut in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) working as a valet of [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) and the kayfabe sister of [Mira](@/w/mira.md). Over time the sisters' relationship grew more and more bitter, finally coming to a head at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), when Alisa turned heel on her sister and Ostrowski by joining the villainous faction Kawaleria, led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md).
After that Alisa spent almost a year feuding with her sister, which concluded at [Arena X: Kawaleria vs Sojusz](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md), where Mira represented the babyface faction Sojusz, and Alisa the villainous Kawaleria. Mira was defeated by her sister.

Following the feud with her sister, Alisa started making rather irregular appearances in matches against other female wrestlers, such as [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md), Yuu and Chakara. She made her last appearance for KPW at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), where she faced Sixt, Bianca, and [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md). That match marked her last in-ring appearance for the federation, as she oficially announced leaving KPW via social media in April 2021.
