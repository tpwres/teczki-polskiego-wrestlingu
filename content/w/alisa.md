## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2017-2021)

Alisa made her debut in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) working as an valet of [Boski Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md) as kayfabe sister of [Mira](@/w/mira.md). Over the time the sisters' relationship grew more and more bitter, finally culminating at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), when Alisa turned heel on her sister and Ostrowski by joining the villainous faction Kawaleria, led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md). After that Alisa spent almost a year feuding with her sister which concluded at [Arena X: Kawaleria vs Sojusz](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md), where Mira represented the babyface faction Sojusz, and Alisa the villanous Kawaleria. Mira was defeated by her sister. 

After feud with her sister Alisa started making rather irregular appearances in a matches against other female wrestlers, such as [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md), Yuu and Chakara. She made her last appearance for KPW at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), where she faced Sixt, Bianca, and [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md). That match marked her last in-ring appearance for federation, as she oficially left KPW via social media in April 2021.
