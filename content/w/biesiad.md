## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2013-present)

#### Backyard era

Biesiad Strong joined [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) in 2013, when the federation was still a backyard group. In his early days he wrestled under numerous aliases, with Steven Strong being his main one, but also as KAT, Red Floorfiller, Kakałko and several others. From 2015 he became one of the most active members of PpW's roster, along with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). He managed to win a few backyard era championships, some under his other aliases.

#### Going pro

With PpW's transformation into a professional federation, Biesiad became one of the most important and popular members of the roster. At [Brawl for the Puppies](@/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md) he served as the host and ring announcer. His professional in-ring debut took place at [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md), where he defeated [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md). At [Inside Job](@/e/ppw/2021-09-11-ppw-inside-job.md) he won against [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), despite suffering a serious bleeding accident.

#### PpW Championship reign

At [Mistrz Jest Tylko Jeden](@/e/ppw/2022-03-12-ppw-mistrz-jest-tylko-jeden.md) Biesiad managed to secure a win against three great figures of the PpW roster: Mister Z, Johnny Blade and [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md), in a Fatal Four Way Match.
Thanks to that victory he became the third official [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) in the federation's professional history.
From that point on, Biesiad started a streak of successful title defences against wrestlers such as [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md), Mister Z, [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) and the enforcer of PpW's owner [Jerry Mandecky](@/w/jerry-mandecky.md) - [Kapitan Bazooka](@/w/kapitan-bazooka.md).
His reign finally came to an end at [Ledwo Legalne III](@/e/ppw/2023-06-17-ppw-ledwo-legalne-3.md), where he lost the title to [Steve Kuningas](@/w/steve-kuningas.md), ending his reign after 462 days.

#### The Hardcores

After his defeat at Ledwo Legalne III, Biesiad formed an alliance with his old friend Johnny Blade, to form a team called The Hardcores.
They faced their rivals - Steve Kuningas and Stanisław Van Dobroniak - in a Tag Team Match at [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md). According to their agreement with PpW's producer and their rival, Mister Z, their defeat resulted in The Hardcores being banned from earning any title shots in PpW.
This led to a feud with other hardcore specialists, Isnorr and [Chris X](@/w/chris-x.md). At [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) Biesiad lost his match against Isnorr thanks to Chris X's intervention, but he got his revenge when he attacked Chris during his match against Johnny later that night. At [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) The Hardcores defeated Chris X and Isnorr.

#### Championship pursuit 

At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) Biesiad faced Rambo. The stipulation stated that Biesiad would earn a contender match against Mister Z if he won. However, should he lose, he gets his long hair shaved bald.
During the ending, Mister Z intervened and attempted to prevent Biesiad from winning. Despite that, Biesiad managed to secure a victory over Rambo. After his win, he cut a short promo in which he challenged Mister Z to a match at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md).
Later that night, his intervention in a championship match between [Feager](@/w/feager.md) and Mister Z resulted in Feager's victory. This led to Mister Z setting up a Triple Threat Match for Ledwo Legalne IV, with Feager vs Mister Z vs Biesiad for the PpW Championship.

At Ledwo Legalne IV, Biesiad managed to win his match, becoming the PpW Champion for the second time. 
However, his title reign was cut short. The defeated Mister Z initiated his "plan B", as he introduced the winner of #1 Contender Match and his protégé [Gustav Gryffin],(@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) who immediately proceeded to cash-in his opportunity to face the champion. Gustav managed to defeat the weakened Biesiad, making this second PpW Championship reign last only a few minutes.

#### Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie

During his conflict with Mister Z, who became PpW's "executive producer" after Mandecky's abduction, Biesiad visibly grew tired of Mister Z and his entourage.
In a post-match interview at Ewenement Haze he used the term ["Zmowa"](@/tt/zmowa.md) (_The Collusion_) for the first time, and vowed to end it as soon as possible.
Following the defeat at Ledwo Legalne IV and an unsucessful rematch against Gustav at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), where he lost due to an intervention of other members of Zmowa, Biesiad started gathering an alliance of babyfaces who were also holding a grudge against Zmowa.
He recruited [Samson](@/w/samson.md), [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) to form an alliance called "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie" (_A Collusion Against the Collusion_).
They faced their opponents in a 5-vs-5 Elimination Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md). Despite Biesiad's elimination, the team managed to defeat Zmowa thanks to Goblin, who won the match as the last man standing.

#### Feud with Mister Z

After defeating Zmowa, Biesiad's feud with Mister Z grew even more intense.
At [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) he and Johnny were banned from entering the venue as wrestlers.
They circumvented the ban by simply buying tickets, and managed to save Axel Fox from getting jumped by Mister Z and Legia Łysych ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)), after he declined an offer to join Zmowa.
At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) Mister Z reinstated Biesiad, but challenged him to a Beat the Clock Challenge. Should he lose, he would become Z's bodyguard. Nevertheless Biesiad won, granting himself freedom.

This didn't end the feud with Mister Z, however, as prior to [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) the PpW producer kidnapped and tied up Biesiad's friend Johnny Blade.
Biesiad managed to save his friend and ambush Mister Z at a PM Shooter (PpW's sponsor) shooting range with an assault weapon.
At Teraz Albo Nigdy Biesiad defeated Marco Hammers, but after Johnny's loss to Mister Z, Biesiad was prevented from even approach Z, risking arrest by PM Shooter mercenaries if he did. Strong ignored the warning which resulted in him being taken down and arrested by armed mercenaries during the 20 Typa, 20 Broni Match.

Biesiad remained in captivity for a long time. During the build-up to [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) his friend Johnny attempted to free him from the PM Shooter facility, but during their escape Johnny was fatally shot, and Biesiad himself was recaptured.

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2017)

In February 2017 Biesiad, then working under the alias "Steven Strong", took part in [Dream Factory Wrestling's](@/o/dfw.md) Valentines Day show [Love Hurts, Wrestling Even More](@/e/dfw/2017-02-14-dfw-love-hurts-wrestling-even-more.md). He worked in a Gauntlet Match, which was ultimately won by [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md).

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023-2024)

In 2023 Biesiad made his debut for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at their joint show [MZW+PpW Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md), where he defeated Chris X in a hardcore match. He returned at [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), where he took part in a Triple Threat Match along with [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) and the victorious [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-)

In December 2024 Biesiad took part in [Legacy of Wrestling's](@/o/low.md) [debut show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), where he defeated Olgierd in a PpW Rules Match.

Biesiad was able to show up at the [second event](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), as he was granted a temporary pass by the PM Shooter mercenaries, who guarded him during his appearance. He fought in a Fatal Five Way Match against [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Erik Šlotíř](@/w/erik-slotir.md). He was prevented from winning as his pass expired during the bout, and he was yet again apprehended by the mercenaries.
