## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2020)

Referee Tobias can credit most of his apperances on polish wrestling scene to good working relations between [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) and german independent scene. He debuted at [Project 1: New Beggining](@/e/mzw/2018-10-13-mzw-project-1-new-beginning.md) which started his stint of irregular apperances as referee during MZW "Project" era. During that time - due to referee shortage - he either worked alone, or along [Referee Matt2Hot](sedzia-matt2hot.md). He made his last apperance at [MZW Project 7: Golden Road](2/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md) where he worked along [Sędzia Michał](@/w/sedzia-michal.md)

Besides his apperances on polish wrestling scene Tobias is most notably known for his time at german independent scene - most notably Unlimited Wrestling.
