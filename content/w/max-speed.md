## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-present)

#### Debut and early feuds

Max Speed made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) in July 2023 at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md), where he faced [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), however he lost due to [Rafi Rarytas's](@/w/rafi.md) attack on Longman.
Max adapted a babyface persona of a super-quick wrestler with high-level agility and speed.
Later on, he fought two matches against his two mentors from [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) - [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md).
He was defeated in both of these fights, as well as in a match against [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md).
At [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) he took part in the Gold Rush Rumble at [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), ending up eliminated by [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md).
Making his way up the ramp, he was taunted by [Karol "Iskra" GÃ³rski](@/w/iskra.md) which resulted in Max superkicking the cocky heel. This mini-feud lasted until [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) where Speed defeated Iskra, securing the first victory in his career.

#### Feud with Brave and Caravaggio

After the drama and [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) following the controversial [PTW #6: Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), in a June 2024 show Max Speed stated he had decided to stay in PTW.
As one of the top babyfaces in PTW's midcard, he started a feud with [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) - the main midcard heels at the time.
Speed won his match against Brave at [PTW x Ryucon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md), but lost to Caravaggio at [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md). After that he fought against Italian wrestlers [Rust](@/w/rust.md) and [Luca Bjorn](@/w/luca-bjorn.md) before teaming up with the up-and-coming babyface [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) against Brave and Caravaggio, who were taunting them in the "Alex Brave Show" segment beforehand. Speed and Shida were however defeated by the villainous tag team.

#### Championship pursuits

Later on, Max Speed earned his opportunity to face Puncher for the PTW Championship in the first main event of his career. He was defeated by the reigning champion.
