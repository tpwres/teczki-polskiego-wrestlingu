## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-present)

#### Debut and early feuds

Max Speed made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) in July 2023 at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) where he faced [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), he however lost due to [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md) attack on Longman. He adapted a babyface persona of super-quick wrestler with high level agility and speed. Later on, he fought two matches against his two mentors from [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) - [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md). He was defeated in both of these fights, as well as in a match against [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md). 
At [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) he took part in Gold Rush Rumble for [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) but he was eliminated by [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md). Making his way up the ramp he was taunted by [Karol "Iskra" GÃ³rski](@/w/iskra.md) which resulted in Max superkicking the cocky heel. This mini-feud lasted until [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) where Speed defeated Iskra, securing his first victory in career.

#### Feud with Brave and Caravaggio

After PTW's drama and [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) after controversial [PTW #6: Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) in June 2024 show Max Speed has decided to stay in PTW. As one of top babyfaces in PTW's midcard scene he started a feud with [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) - main midcard heels at the time. He won his match against Brave at [PTW x RyuCon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md), but lost to Caravaggio at [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md). After that he fought against italian wrestlers [Rust](@/w/rust.md) and [Luca Bjorn](@/w/luca-bjorn.md) before teaming up with up-and-coming babyface [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) against Brave and Caravaggio, who were taunting them over in "Alex Brave Show" beforehand. They were however defeated by villainous tag team. 

#### Championship pursuits

Later on, Max Speed earned his opportunity to face Puncher for the PTW Championship in the first main event of his career. He was defeated by reigning champion.
