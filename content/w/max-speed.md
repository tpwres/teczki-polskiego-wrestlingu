## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-2025)

#### Debut and early feuds

Max Speed made his debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) in July 2023 at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md), where he faced [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), however he lost due to [Rafi Rarytas's](@/w/rafi.md) attack on Longman.
Max adapted a babyface persona of a super-quick wrestler with high-level agility and speed.
Later on, he fought two matches against his two mentors from [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) - [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md).
He was defeated in both of these fights, as well as in a match against [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md).
At [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) he took part in the Gold Rush Rumble at [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md), ending up eliminated by [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md).
Making his way up the ramp, he was taunted by [Karol "Iskra" Górski](@/w/iskra.md) which resulted in Max superkicking the cocky heel. This mini-feud lasted until [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) where Speed defeated Iskra, securing the first victory in his career.

#### Feud with Brave and Caravaggio

After the drama and [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) following the controversial [PTW #6: Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), in a June 2024 show Max Speed stated he had decided to stay in PTW.
As one of the top babyfaces in PTW's midcard, he started a feud with [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) - the main midcard heels at the time.
Speed won his match against Brave at [PTW x Ryucon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md), but lost to Caravaggio at [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md). After that he fought against Italian wrestlers [Rust](@/w/rust.md) and [Luca Bjorn](@/w/luca-bjorn.md) before teaming up with the up-and-coming babyface [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) against Brave and Caravaggio, who were taunting them in the "Alex Brave Show" segment beforehand. Speed and Shida were however defeated by the villainous tag team.

#### Championship pursuits

Later on, Max Speed earned his opportunity to face Puncher for the PTW Championship in the first main event of his career. He was, however, defeated by the reigning champion.

Two months later, Speed faced [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) in a Ladder Match at [Wiosenna Bijatyka](@/e/ptw/2025-03-15-ptw-wiosenna-bijatyka.md), winning the newly-created [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md). He held the title for 109 days, with his final defence being at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md) against [El G](@/w/el-g.md).

#### Leaving PTW

On 2.07.2025 PTW [announced][speed-zwolniony] that Max Speed was fired from the promotion, and his Underground title belt was vacated. Initially, no official reason was given. However, given that [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md) happened just four days before, and that the event included both a title defense and a Gold Rush Rumble for #1 Contendership, it's likely that the decision had been made earlier.

The following week Max posted a farewell message on his social media, thanking several former and current PTW personalities, starting with [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) but also including [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) and [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). He wrote that he left the organization to seek further progress as a wrestler, and that "exploring the entire Polish wrestling scene can give me so much more". However, Max also wrote that he valued time spent there, recalled his debut match, his first mentors, and the people he trained himself - [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md) and [Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025-present)

Max made a surprise debut in Legacy of Wrestling at their [third show](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md), as [Marco Hammers's](@/w/marco-hammers.md) mystery opponent. Introduced by Wiktor Longman as another familiar face, he received chants of "Welcome Home" (_Witaj w domu_) from the audience. He went on to win the match by DQ, when Marco hit him with a chair in full view of the referee.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2025-present)

Two months later, in September 2025, [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) announced Max Speed would debut for their federation at [MZW Zjedz Mu Łeb](@/e/mzw/2025-09-27-mzw-zjedz-mu-leb.md), facing [Febus 'The Wolf'](@/w/apollo-anderson.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) in a Triple Threat Match.

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2025-present)

Max Speed made his unannounced debut for [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) in the pre-show of [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md), where he faced [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md) and rookie Antek in a Triple Threat Match.

## International wrestling appearances

From 2024 onwards Max started taking international bookings. His debut outside of Poland took place in World Wrestling Austria in January 2024, and he also debuted in Hungary later that year. In 2025 he appeared in a few federations across the Europe, including Ukraine, Austria and Italy.
