At [Underground 6](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md) Klaudiusz made his debut under the nickname "Minion" - a heelish follower of [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), who at that time feuded with [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). Minion was quickly defeated by the Spanish wrestler and has never made his return.

Klaudiusz returned to PTW's ring as a referee making his re-debut at [Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md), to fill in as a second referee working with Senior [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), after the suspention of [Referee Rafał](@/w/alex-brave.md) after the ["Asian Scandal"](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md). He continued to make regular appearances in PTW from this point onward.
