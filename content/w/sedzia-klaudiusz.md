## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-present)

#### Debut as Minion

At [Underground 6](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md) Klaudiusz made his debut under the nickname "Minion" - a heelish follower of [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), who at that time feuded with [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). Minion was quickly defeated by the Spanish wrestler and has never made his return.

#### Referee Klaudiusz

Klaudiusz returned to PTW's ring as a referee making his re-debut at [Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md), to fill in as a second referee working with Senior [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), after the suspention of [Referee Rafał](@/w/alex-brave.md) after the ["Asian Scandal"](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md). He continued to make regular appearances in PTW from this point onward. After Sewi's [departure from PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md) following [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), in June 2024 he became Senior Referee of PTW, and has been joined by Referee Herno soon after.

#### Feud with Pawłowski

After [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) turned heel, Herno and Klaudiusz got into a conflict with their boss. They were backed by chairman [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), but despite that they lived in constant fear of being fired from the company. They were especially bullied by [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md) - members of Pawłowski's stable [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) - which resulted in Herno and Klaudiusz announcing an initiative called "Chroń Śląskie Zebry" (_Protect the Silesian Zebras_). Finally they faced Royal Rebels at [Apokalipsa](@/e/ptw/2025-08-30-ptw-apokalipsa.md), in a Tag Team Match for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md), but despite their efforts they were bullied into submission.
