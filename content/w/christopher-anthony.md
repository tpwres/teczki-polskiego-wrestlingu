## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2016-2019)

Christopher Anthony made his debut in Poland working for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at [Champions War II](@/e/mzw/2016-01-10-mzw-champions-war-2.md) in January 2016.
His appearances in the Polish federation were possible thanks to good working relations between MZW and Dresden-based federation Next Step Wrestling.
He worked mostly as an enhancement talent, appearing in multi-man matches along with other wrestlers from Germany.
In total, he made eight appearances for MZW, with the last one taking place at [Project 4](@/e/mzw/2019-03-23-mzw-project-4-open-your-eyes.md), where he faced [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) - who won the match - and [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md).

This marked his last appearance for Maniac Zone Wrestling, as he retired from professional wrestling in the late 2019.
