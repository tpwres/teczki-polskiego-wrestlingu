Krystian Malinowski is the chairman of [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).

Beginning as a trainee in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), he wrestled in two shows before switching his role to that of a referee. After DDW folded and KPW took its place, Malinowski continued refereeing for the new promotion, along with [Karol Górski](@/w/iskra.md) and, from time to time, also Artur Dzwończak.

Before [Arena 12](e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12-gwiazda-polnocy.md), KPW announced that a new chairman would be elected, and Malinowski threw his name in the hat as a candidate, alongside [Krzysztof Zasada](@/w/krzysztof-zasada.md) and [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md).
Eventually he secured the new position at [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13-capo-di-tutti-capi.md) and his previous duties as a referee were taken over by Dariusz Łępicki.
