## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Beginning as a trainee in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), he wrestled in two shows under the ringname "Rex Torpeda" before switching his role to that of a referee.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

After DDW folded and [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) took its place, Malinowski continued refereeing for the new promotion, along with [Karol Górski](@/w/iskra.md) and, from time to time, also Artur Dzwończak.

#### Chairman of KPW

Ahead of [Arena 12](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12.md), KPW announced that a new Chairman would be elected, and Malinowski threw his name in the hat as a candidate, alongside [Krzysztof Zasada](@/w/krzysztof-zasada.md) and [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md).
Eventually he secured the new position at [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md) and his previous duties as a referee were taken over by Dariusz Łępicki.

At [Arena 26: Wyścig](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) Malinowski was attacked with a glass bottle by a mysterious figure and transported to a hospital by medical staff. Rosetti soon informed that Malinowski had officially made him the acting chairman of KPW. Barely [two shows later](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) Malinowski reappeared and took back his position, but the turn of events pushed him into a heel turn, which he fully embraced starting with [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md).

At [Arena XXX: Dekada](@/e/kpw/2025-11-14-kpw-arena-xxx.md), during in-ring celebration of KPW's 10th anniversary, Krystian confronted the reigning [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md) [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md), whom he accused of the attempt at his life a few shows back. He firmly said that no celebration would take place until Zefir left the ring. The Champion instead took his self-made cake and threw it into Krystian's face. Later, after the celebration, the Chairman returned to the ring and fired Zefir in response to his disrespectful actions, while also stripping him of his KPW Championship.
