Eryk Lesak is one of two finalists of [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md)'s 2019 internal competition "Serce do walki" (_Heart for combat_).

Intended as the original butler for the heel stable (which didn't pan out; the position went to [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) instead), he made his debut at [KPW Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md) and started off as a babyface, first working solo and then in a short-lived tag team with the other _Heart for combat_ finalist, Piotr Opolski.

After the initial losing streak, for some of which he blamed Opol, Lesak agreed to join the newly-formed Gałąź Gregoriańska (_The Gregorian Branch_), a heel stable led by [Greg](@/w/greg.md). Having scored his first victory - against Opol at [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19-oko-za-oko.md) - he was joined with Chemik as tag team partners, in a wedding-like ceremony officiated by Greg. However, neither joining the Gregorian Branch nor teaming up with Chemik helped drastically improve his success rate.

In a bit of meta-humour, Eryk's Instagram handle during his babyface days was "faceryk"; after the heel turn, Lesak changed it to [heelesak](https://www.instagram.com/heelesak/).
