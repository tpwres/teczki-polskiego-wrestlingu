Bochen (or Maniek) was a British Shorthair cat about 4 years of age, who owned human wrestler Jakub Linde. Bochen, translated as _loaf_ (of bread) was the cat's nickname, likely given to him for his preference to sit in the loaf position, front paws and tail tucked.

Bochen became a part of [PpW](@/o/ppw.md)'s lore around July 2024, when Linde shared sad news about the cat's health issues.
PpW invited its fans to help by donating money towards the cat's treatment.
About 15 minutes into the livestream of [PpW Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), fans can be briefly heard chanting for Bochen.

Later, Linde shared the crowdfunding page to help nurse Bochen back to health.
During [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md), host [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) auctioned off a T-shirt with Bochen, all proceedings going to the cat's aid.

Unfortunately, despite the support, Bochen died on November 23, 2024.
