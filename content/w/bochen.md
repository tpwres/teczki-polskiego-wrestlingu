Bochen (officially named Armani, or Maniek for short) was a British Shorthair cat about 4 years of age, who owned human wrestler [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md). Bochen, translated as _bread loaf_, was the cat's nickname, likely given to him due to his preference to sit in the loaf position, front paws and tail tucked.

Bochen became a part of [PpW](@/o/ppw.md)'s lore some time in early 2024. The cat gained popularity among fans, and was "feuding" online with Michael HT.
Later, Linde shared sad news about the cat's health issues.
PpW asked their fans to help by donating money towards the cat's treatment.
About 15 minutes into the livestream of [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), fans can be briefly heard chanting for Bochen.

Later, Linde shared the crowdfunding page to help nurse Bochen back to health.
During [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md), an auction was held, where a a T-shirt with Bochen was sold, all proceedings going to the cat's aid.

Unfortunately, despite the support, Bochen passed away on November 23, 2024.
