## Professional wrestling career

### Various backyard promotions (2011-2014)

Over the span of 2010s, Sheen competed for various Polish backyard promotions, including [PXW](@/o/pxw.md), WSW and [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md). He earned the nickname "Aparycja" (_Appearance_), due to his unique look, called out in a [backstage video from Backyardmania IV][bm4].
Per his account, he main-evented the final WKSW show. Most of that promotion's cards and shows are considered lost media.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023-)

Sheen, not announced by name, refereed two MZW shows in 2023.
In 2024, he made his in-ring debut for the promotion at [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) as Tony "The Riverman" Sheen, winning a battle royal. Wearing a fisherman's raincoat and using a fishing net as his signature weapon, the Riverman character seems to take sailor culture as an inspiration. He later added Aquaman-inspired boots and tights into his attire. As a character, he likes to incorporate fishing references into his promos.

At [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md), Sheen faced [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), scoring a win thanks to distraction from [Taras](@/w/taras.md).
