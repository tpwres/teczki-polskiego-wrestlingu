## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Debut and early rivalies

Sentinel made his debut in Poland working for [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md) at their show [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), in a pre-show Fatal Five-Way Match. He quickly got over with PpW's crowd, which resulted in him making rather regular appearances for the promotion throughout 2025. At [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) he took part in Enigma Scramble Match alongside [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) and [Feager](@/w/feager.md). The match concluded in a three-way tie between both masked luchadors and Sambor, granting them a pass to a #1 Contender Ladder Match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md), which was won by [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md). At [Hardcore Friday Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md) Sentinel managed to score a win against the former [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). After the show he got involved in a conflict between Wonder Haze, Sambor and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), which resulted in them facing each other in a Lucha Rules Tag Team Match at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md). The team of Sentinel and Wonder Haze managed to emerge victorious from the rivalry.
