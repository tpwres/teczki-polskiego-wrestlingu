## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Sawicki started his professional wrestling career by training in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) under [Don Roid's](@/w/don-roid.md) guidance. He made one appearance there, when he took part in a Battle Royal during their [house show](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md) in March 2015.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2016-2020)

After DDW transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Sawicki stayed in the federation and made his debut at [KPW Arena 2](@/e/kpw/2016-04-30-kpw-arena-2.md) in April 2016. He debuted in a heel gimmick of a security guard. He quickly aligned himself with [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), with whom he performed for a good part of his tenure in KPW. They managed to find success in the federation's tag team division by becoming the first [KPW Tag Team Champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). Along with Rosetti, Sawicki belonged to [Piękny Kawaler's](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) villainous stable - Kawaleria.

After Sawicki & Rosetti's defeat at [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md), Rosetti turned on his long-time tag team partner and attacked him with a chair. This marks Sawicki's last appearance in KPW, as he left the federation to join the [brand-new project](@/o/ptw.md) started by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021, 2025)

Sawicki was seen at training sessions in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) back when [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) was preparing to launch. He also advertised the federation on his social media channels. After almost four years of silence it was announced that he would make his PTW debut at the Gold Rush Rumble 2 at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md). Prior to this announcement he was widely believed to have retired from pro wrestling.
