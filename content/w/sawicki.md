## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Sawicki started his professional wrestling career by training in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) under [Don Roid's](@/w/don-roid.md) guidance. He made one appearance there, when he took part in a Battle Royal during their [house show](@/e/ddw/2015-03-14-ddw-house-show-1.md) in March 2015.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2016-2020)

After DDW transformed into [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), Sawicki stayed in the federation and made his debut at [KPW Arena 2](@/e/kpw/2016-04-30-kpw-arena-2.md) in April 2016. He debuted in a heel gimmick of a security guard. He quickly aligned himself with [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), with whom he performed for a good part of his tenure in KPW. They managed to find success in the federation's tag team division by becoming the first [KPW Tag Team Champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). Along with Rosetti, Sawicki belonged to [Piękny Kawaler's](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) villainous stable - Kawaleria.

After Sawicki & Rosetti's defeat at [KPW Arena 16: Polowanie](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md), Rosetti turned on his long-time tag team partner and attacked him with a chair. This marks Sawicki's last appearance in KPW, as he left the federation to join the [brand-new project](@/o/ptw.md) started by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021)

Sawicki was seen at training sessions in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) back when [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) was preparing to launch. He also advertised the federation on his social media channels, but never got the chance to debut in PTW's ring, and subsequently retired from pro wrestling.
