## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2024-present)

Referee Herno started his professional wrestling career by joining [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) in January 2023.
After [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) Prime Time Wrestling suffered a large [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md), losing Senior PTW Referee [Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) among others. Herno joined [Referee Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) to form the new referee duo. He debuted at [Halloweenowy Łomot](@/e/ptw/2024-10-19-ptw-underground-23.md), working regularly alongside Klaudiusz ever since.
