## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2024-present)

Referee Herno started his professional wrestling career by joining [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) in January 2023.
After [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) Prime Time Wrestling suffered a large [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md), losing Senior PTW Referee [Sewi](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) among others. Herno joined [Referee Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) to form the new referee duo. He debuted at [Halloweenowy Łomot](@/e/ptw/2024-10-19-ptw-underground-23.md), working regularly alongside Klaudiusz ever since.

#### Feud with Pawłowski

After [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) turned heel, Herno and Klaudiusz got into a conflict with their boss. They were backed by chairman [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), but despite that they lived in constant fear of being fired from the company. They were especially bullied by [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md) - members of Pawłowski's stable [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) - which resulted in Herno and Klaudiusz announcing an initiative called "Chroń Śląskie Zebry" (_Protect the Silesian Zebras_). Finally they faced Royal Rebels at [Apokalipsa](@/e/ptw/2025-08-30-ptw-apokalipsa.md), in a Tag Team Match for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md), but despite their efforts they were bullied into submission.
