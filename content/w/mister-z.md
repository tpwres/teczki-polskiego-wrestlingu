## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2010-present)

#### Early backyard years

Mister Z was one of the earliest members of [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). He joined this backyard organisation back in 2010, when a group of teenage friends and classmates started emulating their favourite wrestlers. Most propably his first match noted in history of polish scene took place in December 2010. From this time on Mister Z continued to make regular apperances in PpW in various roles and under numerous aliases, growing to become one of PpW most active wrestlers along with performers such as [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), or [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). During his backyard years he also won multiple "backyard era" championships.

#### Going professional

After nine years of staying in backyard era PpW's pivoted towards organising more professional shows open for public. At first show oficailly open for general public - [2KOŁA To My Nie Zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md) in December 2019 he faced [impostor of Terry Shadow's persona](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) and Johnny Blade in two separate Singles Matches for [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), which he held back from the backyard times. At [Brawl For The Puppies](@/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md) he faced czech wrestler Šakal in a first PpW Championship title defence against the foreginer. 

#### Various storylines

In June 2021 Mister Z title reign has ended, when he was defeated by [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) at the first show after pandemic lockdown - [Ledwo Legalne I](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md). After that he got involved in numerous matches, including a pursuit to regain his PpW Championship at both [PpW Mistrz Jest Tylko Jeden](@/e/ppw/2022-03-12-ppw-mistrz-jest-tylko-jeden.md) and [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md), but he was unsucessfull in both of these bouts. Around that time he alligned himself briefly with a manager called Ms. XXX, but after his defeat at Ledwo Legalne II she leaved Mister Z to join [Feager](@/w/feager.md). 

#### Alliance with Mandecky and "Executive Producer"

When in May 2022 [Jerry "Rich" Mandecky](@/w/jerry-mandecky.md) took over PpW after buying it from Sun Ju, Mister Z formed a good partnership with the new owner. Opportunistic Mister Z gladly accepted any offer from Mandecky to secure his high position on the card and matches with top-level wrestlers Mandecky could bring in to the PpW. At [Ledwo Legalne III](@/e/ppw/2023-06-17-ppw-ledwo-legalne-3.md) Mister Z reluctantly agreed on Jerry offer to face fan-favourite and his old friend Johnny Blade in a Singapore Cane Match. After the match Mister Z ultimately turned full-on heel after Mandecky's enforcer - [Kapitan Bazooka](@/w/kapitan-bazooka.md) - handcuffed beaten up Johnny to the ropes to punish him for his disobedient behaviour against Mandecky. This caused Mister Z to become one of the most hated wrestlers among the fans, who started to call him "_Mister Zjeb_" (roughly "Mister Retard".

Alliance with Mandecky allowed Mister Z to secure his position at top of the card as promised - at the next shows he faced foregin wrestlers such as Yuval Goldshmit and Asara. He also became the "Executive Producer" of PpW, which allowed him to cut the famous "Deals". He usurped the nickname of "The Real Deal" Mister Z. At [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md) in February 2024 he fought in a brutal Number One Contender Match against [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md). Mister Z won that match which allowed him to face reigning champion - Feager - at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) in April 2024. He failed to defeat his opponent, which seemingly prompted Mandecky to dispose Mister Z using Kapitan Bazooka, but shockingly PpW's owner was attacked and abducted by his own man. Shortly after Mister Z revealed, that due to his contract agreement with Mandecky Mister Z became his legal successor, meaning that "Executive Producer" is the sole authority figure in PpW. 

He was credited for "Prime Time Transfers": a transfer of numerous wrestlers who [leaved PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in late 2023 and 2024. He brought talent such as [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md), [Samson](@/w/samson.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) and numerous others.

#### Creating "Zmowa"

While Mandecky was still a owner of PpW, Mister Z began to slowly build himself a new entourage as executive producer. In late 2023 and early 2024 he approached talent such as [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and his personal trainer [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md), as well as Rafi and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) to convince them into joining his alliance in a simillar fashion Mandecky approached him almost 2 years prior. 

At [PpW Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) Mister Z set up himself against Biesiad, and ruling champion Feager in a Triple Threat Match for PpW Championship. When Biesiad won the match, "Real Deal" immediately called up his protegee - and new #1 Contender - Gustav Gryffin, who managed to defeat Biesiad. After the match, in a post-show interview - Biesiad called this new stable under the leadership of Mister Z "[Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md)" (The Collusion). This name quickly became official, as Zmowa grew up after new Prime Time Transfers - Legia Łysych - joined both PpW and Zmowa. 

Conflict between Zmowa and numerous babyfaces, such as Biesiad, [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), Samson and Pure Gold grew up over most part of 2024, during which Mister Z got involved in a rivalry with [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) in his debut match, when he distracted Polish Fox during his tag team match against Legia Łysych. Rivalry between Zmowa and so-called "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie" under Biesiad leadership led to the Ustawka Match at [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), during which Mister Z called up yet another Prime Time Transfer: [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md). Despite their effort Zmowa ultimately lost to the "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie", which strongly weakened them, but Mister Z managed to hold up core of the Zmowa intact. 

#### Feud with Axel Fox

At [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz Z Krzesłami](@/e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md) Mister Z faced Axel Fox in a Christmas Street Fight. While Axel Fox was eager to get his revagne on PpW's producer for constant backstabbing attacks and avoiding direct confrontation he was unable to defeat "Real Deal" due to [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) intervention and assault on Axel's tag team partner - Goblin. 

At the next show - [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) - Mister Z offered Axel a chance to change his fate in PpW and join Mister Z for the success, instead of alligning himself with "losers", such as Goblin.

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2017)

In September and December 2017 Mister Z - under his "Cade Bruce" alias - made apperances at two shows organised by [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md). He lost to [Prince Victor](@/w/vic-golden.md) and in a [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md) #1 Contender Battle Royale at [DFW Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md). He also lost to [Corin Mear](@/w/corin-mear.md) at [DFW Dream More And Never Stop](@/e/dfw/2017-12-09-dfw-dream-more-and-never-stop.md).

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023)

In September 2023 Mister Z made his debut in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) during the joint MZW and PpW show [Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md), which was held in Wrocław. Mister Z has been defeated by Marcus Monere.
