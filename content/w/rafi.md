## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

Rafi started his pro-wrestling training in [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md), which was [Maniac Zone Wrestling's](@/o/mzw.md) dojo in 2018. He never made a official apperance there as a in-ring performer, but he was spotted there as a ring crew member - most notably as one of camera operators during [MZW Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md) tapings in early 2021. After that he left MZWA in early-to-mid 2021, seemingly on better terms with MZW's authority figures than part of the roster called "[The Greens](@/a/the-greens.md)".

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2023)

Rafi Rarytas made a transfer to [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) shortly after leaving MZW. He debuted at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md), where he won a Contract Battle Royale to secure his future in PTW. He adopted a babyface, happy-go-lucky persona with a "thumbs up" gesture as his signature taunt, often used in fights. He started his singles competition by rivalising with villainous newcomers and low-rank members of the roster, such as [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), who got defeated by Rarytas in a Contract Battle Royal. He quickly created a storyline with [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), who he tried to sway into joining his tag team "Power of Friendship". He was however brutally assaulted by Longman, especially during their fight at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) where he got Piledrivered by Wiktor, which resulted in him being carried out on a stretcher. 

AFter that defeat in a programme with Wiktor Longman Rafi made two more apperances in PTW, with his defeat against [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) at [Underground 17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md) being the last official apperance of Rafi in Prime Time Wrestling. Shortly after that Rafi has [parted ways with the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md), on seemingly bad terms with its owner - [Arkadiusz Paw≈Çowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) - which was very audible in Rafi's various activity in social media.

### PpW Ewenement (2023-2024)

Shortly after leaving PTW Rafi debuted in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). He twisted his persona upside down, with now being cocky villain, who likes to show both midde fingers and thumbs down to the fans. He made his debut at [PpW Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) where he and [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md) got defeated by [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md) in a Three Way Match. After that he also fought in a Critical 4/20 Ladder Match at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md). This was his last apperance as wrestler, but he alligned himself with [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md) - villainous stable led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) - as an associate who worked alongside [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md) helping [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). His last apperance in PpW took part at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md) where he accompanied Gustav and Mister Z in a opening promo segment of the show.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

Rafi was scheduled to face his fellow ex-PTW collegue [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) at [MZW No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) in October 2024. During the show opening he came out and in short promo announced, that the match cannot happen due to him retiring from in-ring competition forced by health issues. He made his last apperance there by filling in for [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) for most of first part of the show.
