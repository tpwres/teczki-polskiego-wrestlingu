## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

Rafi started his pro-wrestling training in [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md), which was [Maniac Zone Wrestling's](@/o/mzw.md) dojo in 2018. He never made an official appearance as an in-ring performer, but he was spotted there as a ring crew member - most notably as one of camera operators during [MZW Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md) tapings in early 2021. After that he left MZWA in early-to-mid 2021, seemingly on better terms with MZW's authority figures than part of the roster who called themselves "[The Greens](@/tt/zieloni.md)".

### Prime Time Wrestling (2022-2023)

Rafi Rarytas chose to join [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) shortly after leaving MZW. He debuted at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md), where he won a Contract Battle Royale to secure his future in PTW. He adopted a babyface, happy-go-lucky persona with a "thumbs up" gesture as his signature taunt, often used in fights. He started his singles competition by facing villainous newcomers and low-rank members of the roster such as [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), previously defeated in the mentioned Contract Battle Royal. He quickly created a storyline with [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), whom he tried to sway into joining his tag team "Power of Friendship". Rafi was however brutally assaulted by Longman, especially during their fight at [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) where he got Piledrivered by Wiktor, which resulted in him being carried out on a stretcher.

After that defeat in a programme with Wiktor Longman, Rafi made two more appearances in PTW, with his defeat against [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) at [Underground 17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md) being Rafi's last match in Prime Time Wrestling. Shortly after that Rafi has [parted ways with the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md), seemingly on bad terms with its owner - [Arkadiusz Paw≈Çowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) - which was very vocal about in his social media activity.

### PpW Ewenement (2023-2024)

Shortly after leaving PTW, Rafi debuted in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). He turned his persona upside-down, becoming a cocky villain who likes to show the middle finger and thumbs down gestures to the fans. He made his debut at [PpW Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) where he and [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md) lost to [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md) in a Three Way Match. After that he also fought in a Critical 4/20 Ladder Match at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md). This was his final appearance as a wrestler, but he aligned himself with [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) - a villainous stable led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) - as an associate who worked alongside [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md) helping [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). His last appearance in PpW happened at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), where he accompanied Gustav and Mister Z in an opening promo segment of the show.

### Return to Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024)

Rafi was scheduled to face his fellow ex-PTW colleague [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) at [MZW No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) in October 2024. During the show's opening, he came out and in a short promo announced that the match cannot happen due to him retiring from in-ring competition, caused by health issues. He made his last appearance there by filling in for [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) for most of the first part of the show.
