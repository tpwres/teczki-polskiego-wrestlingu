## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

Adam Goldschmidt joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) some time in 2024 as a member of the backstage personnel. After the [2024 crisis in PTW](@/a/ptw-crisis.md), which resulted in a [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in May/June (including all of PTW's commentators), Adam pursued his career in PTW as a member of the commentary team. He made his debut at [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) where he was joined by [Krystian "Resivny" Smoleń](@/w/resivny.md). Right from the start he was portrayed as a villainous commentator, who supported all of PTW's heels - including [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) after his heel turn. 

At [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md) Adam unexpectedly entered the Gold Rush Rumble Match, but he was quickly struck down by almost all of the in-ring competitors, before being eliminated from the match.
