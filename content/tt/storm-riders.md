Storm Riders were a short-lived tag team competing in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), formed at some point in 2016.

The team was composed of two masked luchadors: [Red Thunder](@/w/red-thunder.md) and [Blue Thunder](@/w/blue-thunder.md), and a manager named Columbus. The team enjoyed a brief run with the [MZW Tag Team Championships](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md), before losing them to [Catch Connection](@/tt/catch-connection.md) in 2017. Shortly afterwards the team disbanded, and both members only did one more appearance each, in multi-man matches.
