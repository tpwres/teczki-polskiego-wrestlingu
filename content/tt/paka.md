## History

### Debut and initial storylines.

In September 2021, prior to [Revolucja](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), PTW shared an introductory post for PAKA. Presented as common "boys from the block" (as in a block of flats), each of them had a unique colour as well as personality. Boro (wearing a green tracksuit) was PAKA's resident Casanova; Disco Pablo (wearing blue) was the party man; and Taras (wearing red) was "the most reasonable one", initially presented as the leader of the group. Owing to their getup colours, the trio was often refered to as "Atomówki" (_The Powerpuff Girls_).

Taras made his in-ring debut in the opener of PTW's first show ever - [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) - where he faced and defeated German veteran and ex-[WWE](@/o/wwe.md) talent Axel Tischer. During the build-up for the match Taras was hailed as the first-ever alumni trained only in [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md). Boro competed in a battle royal in a losing effort, while Disco Pablo competed alongside [Santino](@/w/santino.md) in a tag team match against [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and Marius Al-Ani, also to no success.

For the first few shows PAKA focused on establishing themselves as babyfaces and [Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) favourites against heels such as [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Remo](@/w/remo.md).

### Feud wih Bad Bones

Later on PAKA got involved in a feud against [Bad Bones](bad-bones.md), who was then trying to destroy Pawłowski and his federation from the inside. At [PTW Underground 6](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md) Boro competed against Bad Bones and suffered a knee injury, which had been his weak point since the MZW days of his career. For the next couple of shows Boro was sidelined as the manager of his PAKA teammates. Later, after one of the training sessions held at the [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md), Taras was beaten up and injured by an annonymous attacker - who, almost two years later, was revealed to be [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md). The feud between Taras and Bad Bones ended when the Polish wrestler was defeated at [PTW x RyuCon 2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md).

### Feud with Pure Gold

Not long after, Taras and PAKA started a feud with [Pure Gold](@/tt/pure-gold.md) - the team of [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - which would later evolve into a Tag Team Tournament for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). PAKA lost the Tag Team Match against Pure Gold at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), but managed to advance to the finals of the Tag Team Tournament while still feuding with Pure Gold, and also with the newly formed heel faction, [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) ([Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)). At [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) Boro lost to Olgierd, while Taras and Pablo competed for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) in a Tables Match main event against Pure Gold. While the heels enlisted the help of Legia Łysych, Boro made a save, fending off Legia Łysych to help his tag team partners secure the victory. Thus, PAKA became the inaugural PTW Tag Team Champions.

### Championship reign

PAKA made their first title defence at [PTW x RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) where they faced [Budapest Bastards](@/tt/budapest-bastards.md). They emerged victorious, but afterwards an attack from Legia Łysych and Vic Golden caused the match to be ruled a no-contest by the referee. Both babyface teams chased the heels off and celebrated together.

After that PAKA's members continued to fight members of Legia and Pure Gold, who formed an alliance to dethrone the champions.
They faced off against Legia Łysych and Gabriel Queen in a six-man tag team match at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md), which was their last match as a trio.

At [PTW Underground #17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md) Boro faced [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) who at that time was feuding with Pawłowski. During that match Boro suffered a kayfabe knee injury caused by Longman, and was officially sent to France to rehabilitate for an undisclosed amount of time. This turned out to be Boro's final PTW appearance.

As Legia and Pure Gold broke their alliance and focused on fighting each other, PAKA moved on to the next task. The build-up to their next title defence started, with both Budapest Bastards and [Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md) staking their claim to the titles.
In just their second defence at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), Taras and Pablo faced Budapest Bastards, MxM Collection and Sinister Kingdom, losing the PTW Tag Team Championship to the Bastards.

### Final feuds and break-up

After the post-Gold Rush reveal that Wiktor Longman was the one who attacked Taras almost two years prior, Longman announced that he would destroy Pawłowski and his allies from PAKA. Since Boro had already been seriously injured by him previously, Longman's next target was Taras.
At [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) Taras lost to Wiktor Longman and was kayfabe injured by him to such a degree that he had to be carried out on a stretcher. It was Taras's final appearance in the PTW ring as he officially left the federation not long after.
At the same show, Sinister Kingdom orchestrated a celebration of PAKA's demise. They joked around, blew party horns and declared themselves the top team in PTW.

With Pablo failing to save Taras from Longman in time, he became the last PAKA member standing, intent to get revenge on Longman. This led to Pablo vs Longman No Holds Barred Match at [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), which was won by Longman. This marked Pablo's last appearance in PTW, as he [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) soon after.

Despite not appearing since September 2023, Boro had not officialy [quit the promotion](@/a/ptw-exits.md) until June 2024, when he posted his "Last Dance Story" in which he clearly supported wrestlers leaving PTW, such as his teammates from PAKA and the members of his ["Green Gang"](@/tt/zieloni.md).

#### Encore

While Boro and Taras seemingly retired, Disco Pablo continued to compete on the Polish scene, in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) as well as [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md). At [Legacy #1](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) Pablo held a musical chairs contest, but during the game a masked assailant barged into the ring and viciously attacked both Pablo and [Piotr Małecki](@/w/piotr-malecki.md). After unmasking and revealing himself to be Taras, he finished off Pablo with a GTS and put Małecki through a table. Subsequently, Taras stated that he'd been abadoned by his partners almost eight months prior and declared that PAKA was officially disbanded.
