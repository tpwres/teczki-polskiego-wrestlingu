Rodzina (_The Family_) is a villainous stable active in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). 

## History

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Formation

At [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) - who managed [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md), and formed a team called "Agencja" (_The Agency_) - set him for a match against "The Legend of Polish Wrestling Scene" [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), at that time still a member of [Pure Gold](@/tt/pure-gold.md). The match pitch was accepted by Oskar as a chance to prove himself against a wrestler he respected a lot. 

At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) Vic finally turned his back on [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), becoming one of the most hated wrestlers in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md). This started a feud between them, leading to their match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) during which Vic defeated Gabriel thanks to the assistance from a masked person who attacked Queen with a chair. It was quickly revealed that the person was Oskar himself.

In a post-match interview it was confirmed that Oskar and Agentka Agatka would join Golden, forming an alliance later to be named "Rodzina", with Vic becoming a Patriarch of the group.

#### Feud with Gabriel Queen

Rodzina continued to feud with Gabriel Queen. While Vic managed to advance in a [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) Contender Tournament by defeating [Axel Fox](@/w/jakub.md), Gabriel did the same thing by viciously defeating Vic's protégé Oskar in a Bullrope Match at [Hardcore Friday Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md). In a post-show promo Vic announced that Rodzina would soon accept their new member.

During the build-up for [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md), Queen vowed to strike down "the Cuckold Father of Oskar" for good. At the same time Oskar got into a conflict with [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) by disrespecting him and his [kabanosy][kabanosy]. This led to Stanisław facing his "Mother" Agatka in a Custody of Oskar Match at the same show. The match quickly evolved into a Tornado Tag Team Match between Agencja and Stanisław & [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). During the match the victory of Agencja was granted thanks to an intervention of Rodzina's new member, [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md).

After Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2 the feud between Rodzina and Queen continued, with Oskar and Vic being challenged for a Tag Team Match at [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md). To help him in the fight, Gabriel recruited his old mentor and another Polish wrestling legend: [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), making his return to wrestling. Rodzina came out on top. Soon after at [Duch Świąt, Smak Krwi](@/e/ppw/2025-12-06-ppw-duch-swiat-smak-krwi.md), the Queen vs Golden conflict finally concluded, as Gabriel lost the Loser Leaves PpW Match. However, thanks to a deal made by Vic and PpW's producer [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), Vic graciously offered Gabriel to stay in the federation under one condition: GQ had to become Rodzina's member. Having no other choice Queen reluctantly agreed, thus being forced into becoming one of Vic's puppets.

#### Tag Team Championship pursuit

Rodzina managed to secure their spot in the tournament finals for the [PpW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ppw-tag-team-championship.md) by defeating [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) and [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md) at [Surowy Klimat](@/e/ppw/2025-11-08-ppw-surowy-klimat.md). At [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście [Hardcore Edition]](@/e/ppw/2026-01-16-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie-hardcore-edition.md) they were however unsucessful in denying the team of [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) a spot in the match thanks to Gabriel and Oskar's animosities during the Golden Opportunity Contendership Match. After the show, Oskar announced that Vic managed to [recruit one more member into Rodzina][rodzina-kolejny] to grant them PpW Tag Team Championship victory at [Dwa na Dwa](@/e/ppw/2026-02-28-ppw-dwa-na-dwa.md). At [Jednak Hardcore](@/e/ppw/2026-01-31-ppw-jednak-hardcore.md), [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) - still an active [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestler - interfered in a match between [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Axel Fox](@/w/jakub.md) as a mystery attacker. Initially giving an impression he's a member of [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md), he was quickly joined by members of Rodzina and they celebrated together, thus confirming Filip as a new family member.
