## History

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Formation

At [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) - who was a manager of [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexadner.md) and formed an team called "Agencja" (_The Agency_) - set him a match against "The Legend of PSV" [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), who at that time was still a member of [Pure Gold](@/tt/pure-gold.md). The match pitch was accepted by Oskar a)s a chance to prove himself against wrestler he respected a lot. 
At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) Vic finally turned his back on [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) becoming one of the most hated wrestlers in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md). This started a feud between them, leading to their match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) during which Vic defeated Gabriel thanks to the assistance from masked person, who attacked Queen with a chair. It was quickly revealed that the person was Oskar himself.

In a post-match interview it was confirmed that Oskar and Agentka Agatka would join Golden, forming an alliance later to be named "Rodzina", with Vic becoming a Patriarch of the group.

#### Feud with Gabriel Queen

Rodzina continued to feud with Gabriel Queen. While Vic managed to advance in a [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) Contender Tournament by defeating [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), Gabriel did the same thing by viciously defeating Vic's protigee Oskar in a Bullrope Match at [Hardcore Friday: Turniej TypeShit](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md). In a post-show promo Vic announced, that Rodzina will soon accept their new member.

During build-up for [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md) Queen vowed to strike down "The Cuckold Father of Oskar" for good. At the same time Oskar got into conflict with [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) by disrespecting him and his kabanosy-sausages. This led to Stanisław facing his "Mother" Agatka in a Custodity of Oskar Match at the same show. The match quickly evolved into a Tornado Tag Team Match between Agencja and Stanisław & [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). During the match the victory of Agencja was granted thanks to intervention of Rodzina's new member - [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md).

After Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2 feud between Rodzina and Queen continued, with Oskar and Vic being challenged for a Tag Team Match at [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md), with Gabriel recruiting his old mentor and another Polish wrestling legend: [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md).
