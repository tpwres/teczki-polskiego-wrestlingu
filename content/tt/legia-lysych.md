## History

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-2024)

#### Solo careers and formation

Marco Hammers debuted in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md), where he appeared in a PTW Contract Battle Royal Match.
He rocked a heel persona, obsessed with his masculinity and embracing his baldness.

Olgierd debuted at [Underground 13](@/e/ptw/2023-03-26-ptw-underground-13.md) against the veteran [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), adopting the gimmick of a hard-headed hooligan ready to fight anybody at a moment's notice. He was flanked by a valet/kayfabe girlfriend [Karyna](@/w/karyna.md).

Over 2023, both Marco and Olgierd got entangled in a feud with [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md), first solo and then together as hired guns for [Pure Gold](@/tt/pure-gold.md). At [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) Marco helped Olgierd win against [Boro](@/w/boro.md) after supposedly spending three hours under the ring. In a post-match interview by Tobiasz "Skyver" Korzybski, they declared their full-time pairing and the intent to challenge for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). Later that same night, they unsuccessfully interfered in the match between PAKA and Pure Gold, in an attempt to help Pure Gold win the Tag Team Championship tournament finals. 

#### Pure Gold alliance and feud

Over the next couple of shows the team, alongside Pure Gold members, continued to haunt PAKA. At [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) they debuted the official name of their tag team: "Legia Łysych" (roughly _Legion of the Bald_, but heavily leaning into the Polish football fan scene - [Legia][legia-warszawa] is the name of Warsaw's football team that Olgierd proudly supports; in addition to the name, this is also evident in their white-green-and-red scheme, lifted straight from the club's colours).

After losing in a Six-Man Tag Team Match against PAKA, [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) berated the incompetent hooligans and broke up the alliance, only to get laid out.
This led to a pair of Singles Matches against the members of Legia Łysych, in which Gabriel managed to defeat both. As [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) was out with injury at the time, the feud never saw a tag-team match pay-off.

#### Various storylines, Karyna leaves

Over the next few months, the team was left without a clear direction, competing both in singles and tag team matches. In a lead-up to [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), Olgierd realized that [Karyna](@/w/karyna.md) was the only team member with a full head of hair, thus putting her loyalty in question. He gave her an ultimatum - shave her hair or get kicked out of Legia.
When she no-showed the event, Marco and Olgierd decided to shave someone else instead. The victim was supposed to be [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), however he was rescued by Marcin Najman - a Polish ex-boxer and freakfighter, who attacked Legia Łysych and beat up both of them.

Later that night, both Olgierd and Hammers competed in the Gold Rush Rumble to crown the inaugural [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md), but lost. Karyna made an appearance, slapping Olgierd and cutting ties with Legia once and for all. She was never seen on PTW programming again and quietly left the federation in the following months.

#### Final appearances and departure

After Gold Rush, Marco started a programme with [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) - the sole full-time Polish female wrestler in PTW.
As a self-proclaimed misogynist and narcissistic hyper-masculine heel, he taunted Diana with sexist remarks, and later crowned himself the [PTW Intergender Champion](@/c/ptw-intergender-championship.md) after defeating her in an Intergender Match at [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md). Olgierd was on commentary for the match.

At the same show, Olgierd lost the match against [King Kaiden](@/w/king-kaiden.md). As him and Hammers attempted to beat Kaiden down, ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](/w/nano-lopez.md) made a save. The feud with [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) eventually led to her enlisting the help of British wrestler Heidi Katrina. The teams co-main evented [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) in an Intergender Tag Team Match. Legia scored a win, leading Katrina to blame Strong and turn on her.

After the show's universal criticism, the [talent exodus](@/a/ptw-exits.md) started. With workers either announcing they quit PTW or that they stay, Legia gave the impression that they were staying. Marco kept feuding on social media against [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), presumably building up a match at [PTW x Ryucon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md), while Olgierd re-confirmed the team's intent to capture the PTW Tag Team Championship.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-)

#### Zmowa

[Pure Gold](@/tt/pure-gold.md) issued an open challenge for [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md). Among the speculation on opponents' identity, Pure Gold continously taunted Legia on their social media channels before the event. Fans didn't take this as anything but a provocation against PTW. Legia, up until the very last moment, appeared to remain committed to PTW, feuding with [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) and defending the legitimacy of the [PTW Intergender Championship](@/c/ptw-intergender-championship.md).

Olgierd and Hammers, teaming together as Legia Łysych, answered Pure Gold's challenge to everybody's surprise. With microphones in hand, they cut a heel promo crediting PpW's top villain [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) as the person who convinced them to jump ship. This quickly established them as villains. Legia were victorious in their unexpected debut, and an official confirmation of joining the PpW roster followed soon.

Shortly thereafter, Legia Łysych joined ["Zmowa"](@/tt/zmowa.md), a villanous faction led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), feuding against PpW's top babyfaces both in tag team and solo matches.
Legia was part of "Team Zmowa" in an Ustawka Match at [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), in a losing effort.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-)

At [Legacy of Wrestling's](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), each member of Legia had a single match; Olgierd lost to [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), while Marco defeated [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md). Post-match, they both beat Fux down and posed with his [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md).
This led to a championship match between Legia Łysych and Bracia Fux at [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 2](e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), which Legia lost.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-)

At [No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md), Marco made his debut and Olgierd his return to [MZW](@/o/mzw.md). While they both competed in singles matches, they were present in each other's corners and also worked as a tag team in an impromptu battle royal.

The two made their official MZW tag team debut at [MZW Forever](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md), issuing an open challenge. The challenge was answered by a makeshift team of [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), who lost to Legia.
