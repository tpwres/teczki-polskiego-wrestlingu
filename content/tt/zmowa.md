Zmowa (_The Collusion_) was a villainous professional wrestling stable that performed mainly in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), while making sporadic appearances in other Polish promotions such as [MZW](@/o/mzw.md). The group's name came from [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), who started using it during his feud with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), PpW's booker and promotor, and his allies.

## History

The beggining of Zmowa dates back to late 2023/early 2024, when the villainous PpW's producer Mister Z formed an alliance with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and Jakub Linde, Gustav's enforcer. Later on [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) began cooperating with the group. [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) joined Zmowa shortly after their debut at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) where they defeated Pure Gold. In mid-2024 [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) joined Zmowa as their ultraviolent specialist.

It became clear that Zmowa aimed for a total domination in every division of PpW, working together to achieve their goals by supporting each other in matches against their opponents. They become enemies with almost all of the remaining PpW roster, including [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), Pure Gold ([Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) & [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)), [Samson](@/w/samson.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md).

After an intense confrontation at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md), Biesiad announced the formation of an impromptu alliance of babyfaces called "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie" (_The Collusion Against The Collusion_) and challenged Zmowa for a tag team match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md).

The event saw a 5 vs 5 elimination match of [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md), [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) taking on [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), Jakub Linde and the surprise fifth contender, [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) (in his PpW debut). After a long match all but one wrestler on each side were eliminated, leaving only [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md). Eventually Goblin scored pinned his opponent, thus defeating Zmowa. This left the stable visibly damaged, but despite that Zmowa still remained active in a federation, often cooperating with each other in their personal feuds throughout the PpW.
