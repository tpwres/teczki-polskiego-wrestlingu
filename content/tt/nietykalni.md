Nietykalni (_The Untouchables_) is a villainous faction, active in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). It consists of [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md) [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) and [PTW Tag Team Champions](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md), [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md).

## History

### Prime Time Wrestling

#### Pre-formation (2024-2025)

At [PTW Underground 2025](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), Pawłowski turned heel for the first time in his PTW career, aligning himself with [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) and helping him retain his PTW Championship against [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md). Over the course of the next months Pawłowski went on a power trip, stacking the odds against babyfaces and playing favorites with the villains. Besides Puncher, he quickly associated with Brave and Caravaggio, exchanging various favors and giving them praise whenever possible. All three wrestlers got involved in Pawłowski's feud against [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), eventually becoming an official faction.

#### Formation and feud with Team Okoński (May 2025-December 2026)

At [PTW: Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md), Pawłowski brought out Alex Brave and Vincent Caravaggio. He gave them a new tag team name: Royal Rebels. Then he introduced Puncher. Pawłowski praised all three and granted each of them a favour. Alex Brave was allowed to host The Brave Show once again - at the next event, with the best guest ever: Pawłowski himself. Puncher's gift was a harder opponent: Ben Rodgers. Vincent didn't get his wish, because even Pawłowski can't resurrect Caravaggio's late grandmother. However, he offered him and Brave a chance to become champions. He announced the formation of a new faction - "Nietykalni" (_The Untouchables_), consisting of all three competitors and Pawłowski.

Later that same night, Pawłowski inserted Royal Rebels mid-match into the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) bout between [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md) and a makeshift team of ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) and debuting [Daniel Razor](@/w/daniel-razor.md). The rules were changed to a Tornado Tag Team Match which, combined with two original teams being already spent, allowed Royal Rebels to easily capture the Championship.

The feud betwen Nietykalni and Okoński continued throughout the following shows. At [Złoto dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md) Okoński made a gentlemen's bet with Caravaggio. If Okoński throws out any member of the team from the Gold Rush Rumble match, Caravaggio will get his logo tattooed. If the opposite happens, Okoński will apologize for insulting Caravaggio's late grandmother Matylda. Despite Okoński winning the bet, Caravaggio refused to comply.

On 19.07.2025 PTW promoted a show named after the faction - [PTW: Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md), where Okoński and Spartan officially formed an alliance against Pawłowski's faction.

Over the following months, Nietykalni continued to haunt Okoński and the babyfaces. Eventually, Team Okoński formed to face them.
At [Halloweenowa Rozpierducha](@/e/ptw/2025-10-25-ptw-halloweenowa-rozpierducha.md) the teams faced off in a 4 on 4 Elimination Match with future titleshots for the babyfaces hanging in the balance. ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) turned on Team Okoński, attacking [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) and thus eliminating himself from the match. His further beatdown of Spartan secured the win for Nietykalni. Post-match he celebrated together, while commentary confirmed he is indeed the 5th member of Nietykalni.

#### Loss of leader

At [Totalna Anihilacja](@/e/ptw/2025-11-15-ptw-totalna-anihilacja.md) Pawłowski returned to in-ring competition, teaming up with his champion Puncher in a Three Stages of Hell Match against Okoński. In it, he was pinned by Okoński twice, costing Pawłowski's team the victory. Nietykalni's defeat meant that Spartan was once again eligible to face Puncher for the PTW title, which enraged the reigning Champion.

In the main event of [Świąt Nie Będzie](@/e/ptw/2025-12-13-ptw-swiat-nie-bedzie.md) both Puncher's PTW Championship and Pawłowski's career were on the line in an All Or Nothing Match against Spartan, supported by Łukasz Okoński. Despite all the tricks and shenanigans pulled off by Pan Pawłowski and Nietykalni, Spartan was finally able to finish his story. Devastated, Arkadiusz spent the next couple of weeks looking back at moments from his wrestling journey on his social media, which included short stories from both [DDW](@/o/ddw.md) and [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), as well as the beginnings of PTW.

At [Odrodzenie](@/e/ptw/2026-01-31-ptw-odrodzenie.md) he closed the show by making his farewell speech, seemingly reverting to his good guy persona. He granted parting gifts to all the Nietykalni members present, still posing as their leader. After that Pawłowski bid farewell to PTW's ring and revealed that he had been supposedly headhunted by one of "major international wrestling promotions", where he would continue his career.
