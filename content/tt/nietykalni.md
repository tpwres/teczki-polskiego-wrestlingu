## History

### Prime Time Wrestling

#### Pre-formation (2024-2025)

At [PTW Underground 2025](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), Pawłowski turned heel for the first time in his PTW career, aligning himself with [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) and helping him retain his PTW Championship against [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md). Over the course of the next months Pawłowski went on a power trip, stacking the odds against babyfaces and playing favorites with the villains. Besides Puncher, he quickly associated with Brave and Caravaggio, exchanging various favors and giving them praise whenever possible. All three wrestlers got involved in Pawłowski's feud against [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), eventually becoming an official faction.

#### Nietykalni become official (May 2025-)

At [PTW: Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md), Pawłowski brought out Alex Brave and Vincent Caravaggio. He gave them a new tag team name: Royal Rebels. Then he introduced Puncher. Pawłowski praised all three and granted each of them a favour. Alex Brave was allowed to host The Brave Show once again - at the next event, with the best guest ever: Pawłowski himself. Puncher's gift was a harder opponent: Ben Rodgers. Vincent didn't get his wish, because even Pawłowski can't resurrect Caravaggio's late grandmother. However, he offered him and Brave a chance to become champions. He announced the formation of a new faction - "Nietykalni" (_The Untouchables_), consisting of all three competitors and Pawłowski.

Later that same night, Pawłowski inserted Royal Rebels mid-match into the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) bout between [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md) and a makeshift team of ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) and debuting [Daniel Razor](@/w/daniel-razor.md). The rules were changed to a Tornado Tag Team Match which, combined with two original teams being already spent, allowed Royal Rebels to easily capture the Championship.

The feud betwen Nietykalni and Okoński continued throughout the following shows. At [Złoto dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md) Okoński made a gentlemen's bet with Caravaggio. If Okoński throws out any member of the team from the Gold Rush Rumble match, Caravaggio will get his logo tattooed. If the opposite happens, Okoński will apologize for insulting Caravaggio's late grandmother Matylda. Despite Okoński winning the bet, Caravaggio refused to comply.

On 19.07.2025 PTW promoted a show named after the faction - [PTW: Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md), where Okoński and Spartan officially formed an alliance against Pawłowski's faction.

Over next months, Nietykalni continued to haunt Okoński and babyfaces. Eventually _Team Okoński_ formed to face them.
At [Halloweenowa Rozpierducha](@/e/ptw/2025-10-25-ptw-halloweenowa-rozpierducha.md) the teams faced off in a 4 on 4 Elimination Match with future titleshots for babyfaces hanging in the balance. ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) turned on Team Okoński, attacking [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) and thus eliminating himself from the match. His further beatdown of Spartan secured the win for Nietykalni. Post-match he celebrated together, while commentary confirmed he is indeed the 5th member of Nietykalni.
