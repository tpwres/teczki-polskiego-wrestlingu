Die Ordnung are a team of German wrestlers [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) and [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md), known for their time in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) where they held the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) for 11 months. Outside of Poland, the team made one appearance in Hamburg-based Nordisch Fight Club.

## History

Die Ordnung won the KPW Tag Team Championship on their KPW debut during [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md), in a Four-Way Elimination match against [Bracia Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md), [Gałąź Gregoriańska](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md), and the team of [Primate](@/w/primate.md) and Tommy Freeman. Primate was the previous holder of the belt, as part of [The Hunt](@/tt/the-hunt.md), but his partner [Wild Boar](@/w/wild-boar.md) had to sit out the match due to an injury, forcing the organization to vacate the belts.

They feuded over the titles with Bracia Fux, defending them successfully on the first occasion, but lost them at the [next year's Godzina Zero](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md). Since then, Schulte found success in singles competition, winning the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) from [Red Scorpion](@/w/red-scorpion.md), while Müller did not make any appearances, until he was announced for [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md).

As a team, they employed straightforward, classic foreign heel gimmicks, especially playing up the "evil German" stereotype.

The 2025 [house show at Trzebień](@/e/kpw/2025-09-13-kpw-trzebien.md) saw the debut of "Die Ordnung 2.0", consisting of Einar Asmussen & Friedrich Pohlmann and Friedrich Pohlmann (according to [Cagematch][cm-trzebien-wyniki]) or Franz & Friedrich (according to [KPW's Facebook post][kpw-trzebien-wyniki]).
