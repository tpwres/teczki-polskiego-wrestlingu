## History

Following the loss to [Bracia Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md) at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md), [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) began to blame his tag-team partner [Piotr Opolski](@/w/piotr-opolski.md) for this turn of events - a sentiment that was fueled by [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md). At the [next show](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md) Lesak was supposed to have a rematch against the Fux Brothers, this time with the former [KPW Tag Team Champion](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) as his new partner. Rosetti was late for the show, however, which prompted [chairman Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) to declare this a two-on-one handicap match. The Brothers proved too much for Lesak to handle alone, so he gave up the fight by walking away and being counted out.

Later at the same show Rosetti appeared and [cut a promo][rosetti-tlumaczy] explaining his reasons for being late (he was stuck at the Polish-Ukrainian border on his way back from [helping the Russians][inwazja]), asked Lesak to join him in the ring and told him that there was a group forming in KPW - a group of people tired of Malinowski's games. Around a month later KPW [released a video][decyzja-lesaka] in which Eryk Lesak made his decision and joined Gałąź Gregoriańska.

At [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19.md) [Greg](@/w/greg.md) held a marriage-like ceremony, swearing in a new tag team of Chemik and Eryk Lesak. From this moment on the Branch began to grow stronger, which culminated in Greg winning the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) and Rosetti capturing the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), both at [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md). The situation remained stable for around two years, but cracks began to show when Chemik backstabbed Rosetti and snatched the Old Town title from him at [Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md), making Rosetti feel betrayed and increasingly disillusioned with the Branch.

Two show later, at [Godzina Zero 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md), Greg faced [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) in their third hardcore match, but lost to the former KPW Champion. Unexpectedly, despite losing, Greg showed no hostility towards Corvus, instead shaking his hand and even hugging him. This proved the final straw for Rosetti, who ran into the ring and launched a vicious attack on Greg. A short while later Chemik and Lesak arrived and chased Rosetti away, only to turn on their former leader. After hitting him with their finishers, they cut a short promo berating him as a failure and stating they don't need him any more. This marked the end of the group.
