Sinister Kingdom was a stable active in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) between 2022 and 2024. While they did not hold any titles in the federation, they were nevertheless important in several storylines during that time.

## History

### Krampus

The stable began during [Sinister's](@/w/sinister.md) feud with ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). The two were scheduled for a Last Man Standing match at [PTW 3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). While Nano was all but sure to win that match, he was attacked by [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md), who allied himself with Sinister. Following that, Sinister did not step in the ring much, focusing on managing Krampus instead. At the same show, [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) - then allied with [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) - was laid out by [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) during a segment with [Samson](@/w/samson.md).

### Dziedzic

At [Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md), fed up with his losing streak, Syriusz Dziedzic quit PTW after his match. Two months later, at [PTW 4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), Syriusz was sitting with the audience, as Wiktor Longman laid out his opponent and then called Dziedzic to the ring. The two exchanged words about what had happened at [Underground 10](@/e/ptw/2023-01-28-ptw-underground-10.md), when as a team they lost to [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md) in the first round of the Tag Team Tournament. Dziedzic accused Longman of not being there for him and not protecting him, finally calling him a coward. This angered Longman, who hit Dziedzic with his finisher and left the ring. Microphone in hand, the distraught Syriusz yelled for Sinister, who entered slowly, Krampus in tow and "I Got You Babe" playing. Finally, Sinister hugged Syriusz, but followed with a kick, pushing him into Krampus, who then hit his finisher. After this warm welcome, Krampus carried the unconscious Dziedzic to the backstage.

At the next show [Ryucon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md), Krampus faced Samson. Sinister and Syriusz Dziedzic were present in his corner, with the latter sporting a new look, entrance theme and a new, aggressive moveset. Just two weeks later, at [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md), Sinister re-baptized Syriusz in a dark in-ring ceremony, changing his name to just Dziedzic. From then onwards, Dziedzic won all his matches, often with Sinister's help.

### Sinister Kingdom

At [PTW 5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), Sinister Kingdom faced three other teams for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md), to no avail. Later in the show Krampus competed in the Gold Rush Rumble eliminating [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), before Nano Lopez came out to the ringside with a bound Sinister, forcing Krampus to chase him and abandon the match.
This angle was left unresolved as at the next show, [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md), Sinister and Dziedzic appeared only to celebrate the demise of PAKA, after which they were chased out by [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), seeking revenge on Dziedzic.

The group's final appearance came at [PTW 6: Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), where they interfered with the main event, laying out both [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) and Babathunder, leaving the match without a winner.

Both Sinister and Dziedzic [left the federation](@/a/ptw-exits.md) soon after. Krampus remained, but has since made only one appearance at [Walczymy Dla Fundacji](@/e/ptw/2024-09-29-ptw-walczymy-dla-fundacji.md).

### Legacy of Wrestling

Dziedzic and Sinister chose to join the newly created [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md). No longer a team, and with Dziedzic returning to his old name, their history was acknowledged, and took on a new angle.
