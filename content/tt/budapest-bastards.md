Budapest Bastards were a tag team of Hungarian wrestlers [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md) and [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md), formed in 2017 in HCW Pankráció (known internationally as Hungarian Championship Wrestling). They held the HCW Tag Team Championship between 2018 and 2020. In Poland, both wrestlers competed for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) between 2021 and 2024.

## History

### DDW and KPW (2012-2015)

Renegade debuted in Poland in 2012, working for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md). His most important achievement there was advancing to the finals of the [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) tournament, losing only to [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md).

Nitro's Polish debut came in 2013 at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md), where Renegade defended his HCW Championship against [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md). The two Hungarians later returned to the newly-formed [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), competing in singles matches at [KPW vs the World](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

The Bastards were present at PTW's first [Underground](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md) show in December 2021, although still not as a tag team. They didn't compete in the inaugural tournament for PTW's [Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) either. Another Hungarian team - Arrows of Hungary, made up of [Dover](@/w/dover.md) and Icarus - won in the first round, but lost to [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md) in the semifinals.

Budapest Bastards then debuted at [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) in a #1 Contendership Match for the tag team belts, which they won, and later faced the champions at [RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md), although the match was ruled no-contest due to an intervention by [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md).

#### Tag Team Champions

Their next bout against PAKA was successful: they faced the champions, and two other tag teams, in a four-way match at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md). Their competitors, also vying for the title, were MxM Collection, i.e. the former WWE stars Mansoor and Mason Madden; and [Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md), the team of [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md).

Bastards then defended their titles three more times, including once against another Hungarian team of The Gulyas Bros (Gulyás Öcsi and Gulyás Vilmos). However, at the end of 2024, at the [final Underground show](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), they dropped the belts to [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md), a team of [Luca Bjorn](@/w/luca-bjorn.md) and [Rust](@/w/rust.md), and in a closing promo parted ways with the organization.
