Budapest Bastards were a tag team of Hungarian wrestlers [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md) and [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md), formed in 2017 in HCW Pankráció (known internationally as Hungarian Championship Wrestling). They held the HCW Tag Team Championship between 2018 and 2020. In Poland, both wrestlers competed for [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) between 2021 and 2024.

## History

### DDW and KPW (2012-2015)

Renegade debuted in Poland in 2012, working for [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md). His most important achievement there was advancing to the finals of the [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) tournament, losing only to [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md).

Nitro's Polish debut came in 2013 at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md), where Renegade defended his HCW Championship against [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md). The two Hungarians later returned to the newly-formed [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), competing in singles matches at [KPW vs the World](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md).

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

The Bastards were present at PTW's first [Underground](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md) show in December 2021, although still not as a tag team. They didn't compete in the inaugural tournament for PTW's [Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) either. Another Hungarian team - Arrows of Hungary, made up of [Dover](@/w/dover.md) and Icarus - won in the first round, but lost to [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md) in the semifinals.

Budapest Bastards then debuted at [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) in a #1 Contendership Match for the tag team belts, which they won, and later faced the champions at [Ryucon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md), although the match was ruled no-contest due to an intervention by [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md).

#### Tag Team Champions

Their next bout against PAKA was successful: they faced the champions, and two other tag teams, in a four-way match at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md). Their competitors, also vying for the title, were MxM Collection, i.e. the former WWE stars Mansoor and Mason Madden; and [Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md), the team of [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md).

Bastards then defended their titles three more times, including once against another Hungarian team, The Gulyas Bros ([Gulyás Öcsi](@/w/gulyas-ocsi.md) and Gulyás Vilmos). However, at the end of 2024, they dropped the belts at the [final Underground show](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md) to [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md), a team of [Luca Bjorn](@/w/luca-bjorn.md) and [Rust](@/w/rust.md). In a closing promo they then parted ways with the organization. The following year Nitro returned to PTW, but without Renegade.
