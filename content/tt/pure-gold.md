## History

### PTW (2022-2023)

#### Formation and first matches

Shortly after leaving Maniac Zone Wrestling, [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) joined the newly created [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), making his debut as a joke entrant in a battle royal during [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he was the first one to be eliminated. 
He continued to appear at every PTW show, keeping a losing streak in singles competition. He got involved in an angle where he started looking for a proper partner, disappointed in Taxi Złotówa's incompetence. 
Meanwhile, [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) debuted at the [third Underground show](@/e/ptw/2022-03-27-ptw-underground-3.md), also losing a few singles matches in a row. 

After Golden's loss to [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) at [Underground 5](@/e/ptw/2022-05-29-ptw-underground-5.md), Queen made an entrance, chair in hand. Instead of attacking Golden, he set up the chair in the ring and offered him a seat. Queen told Golden "widzę siebie w tobie" (_I see myself in[side of] you_), a subtle-ish gay sex pun. He offered Golden an alliance, giving him his sunglasses. Golden accepted Queen's gift and hugged him in the middle of the ring.

#### Tag Team, feud with PAKA

Pure Gold made their debut as a tag team at the following [Underground](@/e/ptw/2022-06-26-ptw-underground-6.md), quickly defeating The Bright Lights ([Iskra](@/w/iskra.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md)). 
Over the following months, they competed in various matches, both as a tag team (undefeated) and in singles competition (to varying degree of success).
They entered a feud with [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md), facing them in various singles matches and then defeating them at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). In the lead-up to the match, Pure Gold made it clear they want to win the tag titles, even though none existed at the time.

#### Tag Team Championships tournament

As Pure Gold's popularity was rising, the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) was finally announced, with a tournament starting at [Underground 10](@/e/ptw/2023-01-28-ptw-underground-10.md). In the first round Pure Gold defeated The Bright Lights once again, while in the semi-finals they defeated FoxJoy ([Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md)). They got involved in a short program with both Axel and Justin, facing them both in singles competition and trying to drive a wedge between the two. They apparently succeeded, as Joy left PTW soon after and never returned.

During the lead-up to the tournament finals, Pure Gold revisited their feud with [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md), who also made it to the finals.
They enlisted the help of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Karyna](@/w/karyna.md), who themselves had issues with PAKA. All four beat PAKA down (with Karyna spraying Boro in the face) in the contract signing segment at [Underground 15](@/e/ptw/2023-05-28-ptw-underground-15.md). The ensuing pandemonium led to [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) making the finals a Tables Match.

At [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) Pure Gold faced PAKA in the finals of the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament. Marco and Olgierd, now an official tag team with their sights also set on the gold, unsuccessfully interfered in the match on Pure Gold's behalf and PAKA left as the inaugural PTW Tag Team Champions.

#### Legia Łysych and departure

Despite the setback, the alliance between two villain teams was not broken. Pure Gold and the newly minted [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) continued to haunt PAKA over the next couple of shows.
After losing a Six-Man Tag Team Match together with Legia against PAKA, [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) berated the incompetent hooligans and broke up the alliance, only to get laid out by the duo.
With Vic Golden absent due to a knee injury, Queen continued to face Legia in a series of singles matches, first defeating Olgierd in an Underground Street Fight and then defeating Marco Hammers at [Underground 18](@/e/ptw/2023-10-01-ptw-underground-18.md). This turned out to be Queen's final PTW appearance as he [left PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md) at an unspecified time in late 2023.
Golden never returned from his injury hiatus and was quietly removed from PTW's roster page in the early 2024.

Besides their PTW run, in 2023 Pure Gold made appearances outside of Poland, for Austrian Rings of Europe and Danish Nordic Elite Wrestling.

### PpW Ewenement (2024-)

#### Reunion

Gabriel Queen made his official debut for [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), where he faced [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) as a babyface.
After securing a victory he was attacked by his defeated opponent, however Queen's tag team partner - [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) - made his surprise debut, saving Gabriel from the beatdown. They celebrated together and hugged, marking the team's reunion, now under PpW's banner.
They quickly made their official PpW tag team debut, defeating Baklava Club's Aytac Bahar and Joshua Amaru at [Ewenement Haze](content/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md).

At [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), Pure Gold issued an open challenge, which was unexpectedly accepted by [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md), at that time still thought to be associated with PTW. The two teams reignited their feud from PTW, delivering a well-received match.
The rivalry with Legia Łysych - especially with [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - continued, and Gabriel faced him at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) in a No Weapons Hooligan Street Fight, which ended in Olgierd's disqualification for using a weapon.
This led to Gabriel and Vic going against the villainous stable [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) in an Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), which they won as part of a coalition against Zmowa, led by [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md).

#### Queen's championship pursuit, break-up

At [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz z Krzesłami](@/e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md) in December 2024 Queen won a Four-way Match, which resulted in [Santa Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) gifting him a contract to face the [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md). 
At that show Queen faced Gryffin in a 15 minute time limit match, but was unable to win the Championship before the time-out.

Though Queen shifted his attention away from tag team competition, Golden seemed to support his championship aspirations, remaining in Gabriel's corner.
At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md) Pure Gold defeated Gustav and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), with Vic Golden pinning Isnorr. Nevertheless, it was Gustav's first defeat during his title reign, and Queen challenged Gustav for a rematch, which he begrudgingly accepted.
At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) Gabriel Queen, with Vic Golden in his corner, faced Gustav Gryffin in another match for the PpW Championship, this time in a Two out of Three Falls stipulation.
Just before Queen went for the second pinfall and victory, Vic Golden turned on him striking him with a chair, which allowed Gustav to retain the championship and end their feud. Gustav celebrated his win, while Vic stood over Queen's motionless body with no interaction between the two heels - making it apparent that Golden is not joining [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md). After Gryffin had left, Golden took off his Pure Gold T-shirt and shoved it in Queen's face, making it clear that Pure Gold is no more.
