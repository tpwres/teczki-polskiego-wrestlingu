Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_) was a professional wrestling stable, active in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) and later [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), between 2015 and 2019. The group distinguished itself by their signature facepaint, using the same entrance music as Piękny Kawaler, and dressing in black. The group's members held all of KPW's championship titles between them at various points in the federation's history.

## History

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2013-2015)

The group was estabilished by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), whom the stable is named after, with [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) and [Greg](@/w/greg.md) as his subordinates. It is unclear which show was the group's debut. At [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md) Kawaler applied the facepaint to Leśny's face, and at [All Or Nothing II](@/e/ddw/2014-08-17-ddw-all-or-nothing-2.md) Luxus wore the facepaint and used Kawaler's entrance music. The official poster for [House Show 2](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md) shows Bianca wearing the facepaint alongside Kawaler. This gives an estimate of the group's formation as late 2013.

In DDW, the group feuded with most babyfaces, intervening in their matches and terrorizing the locker room.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-2019)

As DDW moved to Gdańsk and transformed into Kombat Pro Wrestling, the group remained with the organization. They continued their activity in the new federation. They were the most successful stable in the organisation, with their wrestlers becoming the inaugural champions for each KPW belt: Sawicki and Rosetti winning the [Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md), Piękny Kawaler being crowned the first [KPW Champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md), and Greg capturing the [OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md).

#### Kawaleria vs Sojusz

At [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9.md) Greg faced [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) in a Hardcore Match defending his KPW OldTown Championship. After the match, in which he retained the belt, Kawaleria ran in, attacked and gagged the still-bleeding David. This attack was stopped by the rest of the locker room running in, later joined by Robert Star. The faces formed a new faction, called Sojusz (_The Alliance_).

The two factions clashed at the next show, [Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md), where an 8-man elimination tag team match took place. Adam Bravo, initially on the side of Kawaleria, betrayed the faction by laying down for a pin without a fight, helping the face faction Sojusz win the match. Later that night, faction leaders Kawaler and Robert Star clashed in a Lumberjack Match, where a ref bump denied Robert a win by submission.

#### Robert Star working for Kawaleria

At the following show, [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md), Robert was forced to wrestle for Kawaleria, as part of some contract that Piękny Kawaler exercised over him. The two entered as a team into the inaugural Tag Team Championship tournament, only to be disqualified due to Kawaler being under the influence.

Still wearing the facepaint at [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md), Robert Star defeated [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) to win the KPW championship. After the match, Piękny Kawaler came out and requested that Robert hand the title over to him. Robert refused, and hit Kawaler with a Rockstar Hangover. This resulted in [Chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) firing Robert for breaking the terms of a contract between him and Kawaler, stripping Star of the title, but also suspending Kawaler for attacking the ref at Arena 11. However, at [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md), both wrestlers were reinstated, but did not face each other.

The resolution came at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), when Kawaler challenged Robert to an all-in encounter: a Career vs Career, Last Man Standing, KPW Championship Match. Kawaler, angry with Robert, called him ungrateful for when he refused to hand over the title after Kawaleria helped him win it. After their match, in which Robert was victorious, Kawaler tried attacking him, only to be severely punished by babyfaces present at ringside. Greg ran in, apparently to save his leader.

#### Habemus Papam

Greg did aid Kawaler, preventing further beatdowns. However, instead of helping him exit the ring, he delivered a surprise attack, betraying his now-former leader. This was the definite end of the faction, and Kawaler himself retired from in-ring competition from then on, remaining in coaching and backstage roles.

In the show's closing moments, Chemik appeared behind a pulpit, and, speaking in Latin, announced a new Pope. Then Greg entered, no longer using Kawaleria's entrance music, but to a new theme, wearing long monasterial robes. He stood behind the pulpit and announced himself as the new Pope of Polish wrestling, under the name _Pijus I Greg_. This angle later lead to the creation of a new faction: [Gałąź Gregoriańska](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md).
