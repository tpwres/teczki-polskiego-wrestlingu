Zbójnicy (_The Highwaymen_) were a tag team active in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) between 2015 and 2017, and the organization's first [Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). The team consisted of [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md).

The team's name refers to [Carpathian highwaymen][wiki-zbojnicy], robber bands who roamed the mountains of present-day Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. In folklore they not only robbed the rich but also gave to the poor, and in real life they were often oppressed peasants clawing back wealth from their feudal lords. Later in the 19th century they were also key symbols of resistance and independence. Such is their image in Poland as well - not as robbers, but freedom fighters, and they're perceived as heroes.
