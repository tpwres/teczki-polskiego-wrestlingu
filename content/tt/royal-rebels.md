Royal Rebels are a Polish tag team of [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) and [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md). The two had been performing as singles wrestlers (and, in the case of Brave, a referee prior to that), before forming a tag team and capturing the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) at [PTW Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md) from [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md). 

## History

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-present)

#### Early cooperations

In 2024, [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) formed an unofficial alliance with another heel, [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), to feud against [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md). Both of them began supporting [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) - PTW's owner - after he turned heel on [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) and started his feud against babyface co-owner of federation - [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md). They intervened in a match against PTW's owners at [Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md) by attacking Łukasz, helping Pawłowski to win.

#### Royal Rebels and Nietykalni

At [Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md) Pawłowski expressed his gratitude for both Brave and Caravaggio, praising them for their actions at Prezes vs Prezes. He formed a tag team of Brave and Caravaggio - Royal Rebels - and introduced them into a new Pawłowski-centered faction called [Nietyklani](@/tt/nietykalni.md) (_The Untouchables_), consisting of all of them and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md). They were given the opportunity to face [L'Orda](@/tt/l-orda.md) at the same show. Brave and Vincent managed to score a victory, becoming the new [PTW Tag Team Champions](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). From that point onwards Nietykalni ruled over PTW, constantly feuding with Łukasz Okoński and his allies: Spartan and referees [Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) and [Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md), who tried to stand their ground at [Apokalipsa](@/e/ptw/2025-08-30-ptw-apokalipsa.md), but were bullied into submission by Royal Rebels.
