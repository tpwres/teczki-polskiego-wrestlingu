The Hunt were a tag team of two Englishmen best known for their run in [WWE](@/o/wwe.md) NXT UK: [Primate](@/w/primate.md) and [Wild Boar](@/w/wild-boar.md). 

## History

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2020-2022)

Wild Boar made his first appearance in KPW at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), and Primate two years later at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md). Then at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md) the two faced the reigning [KPW Tag Team Champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) and defeated them.

Not long after Arena 16, however, the COVID-19 restrictions came into effect forcing all Polish promotions to halt their operations, which resulted in no opportunities for The Hunt to defend their newly-won titles. It wasn't until [Godzina Zero 2022](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md) 2.5 years later that The Hunt were to face [Die Ordnung](@/tt/die-ordnung.md), [Bracia Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md) and [Chemik & Lesak](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md) in a Tag Team 4-Way Elimination Match for the titles. Unfortunately, Wild Boar sustained an injury shortly before the event, which forced him to sit out the match. Chairman [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) then decided that the titles would be vacated and the 4-Way Match - now with Tommy Freeman as Primate's partner - would crown the new champions. The match was won by Die Ordnung ([Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) & [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md)), and The Hunt's reign ended without a single defence after 959 days, most of which fell on the COVID-19 lockdown.
