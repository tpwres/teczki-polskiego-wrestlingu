GobLis are a Polish tag team consisting of [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) active in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md).

## History

### PpW Ewenement Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Formation

By the summer of 2024 Goblin was already an established singles star, entangled in an eternal feud against [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). He suffered a loss at [Ledwo Legalne 4](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), but both competitors were far from done with each other.
During the build-up to [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md) Gustav reached out to a member of [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), offering the team a match against the Acid Messiah.

Additionally, unless Goblin was able to find a partner, it was to be a handicap match. This was a problem for him, as many potential allies already had issues of their own - [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) (who'd just lost a tag match to Legia) was facing [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md); [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) challenged Gustav for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) was defending his newly regained [European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) had limited availability due to his Legend's contract. With no potential partners in sight, Goblin enlisted help from [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) who gave him the phone number to a potential partner. The video of their conversation cut short before the phone was picked up, leaving the partner's identity a secret.

At the show, Goblin stood against Legia Łysych alone and cut a short promo, mentioning how Legia got under many people's skin even before they came to PpW in June that year, and that one such person came to PpW to get his hands on them. This marked the surprise debut of [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), who teamed up with Goblin. However, due to [Mister Z's](@/w/mister-z.md) interference in the match, they were unable to defeat Legia Łysych.
PpW fans quickly named the emerging team "GobLis" - a portmanteau of Goblin and Lis (Fox). This became their official name, included in promotional materials and team's merchandise.

#### Zmowa przeciwko Zmowie

Their grudge held against the members of Mister Z's villainous stable [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) (_The Collusion_), and especially against Legia Łysych, caused Goblin and Fox to join an impromptu faction led by Biesiad: Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie (_The Collusion Against the Collusion_). The team of Goblin, Fox, Biesiad, Gabriel Queen and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) faced Mister Z, [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md), Olgierd, [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) in an Ustawka Match at [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md). Zmowa got the upper hand, leaving Goblin alone against Mister Z, Longman and Olgierd, but The Acid Messiah was able to miraculously win the match for his team as the sole survivor.
GobLis's feud with Zmowa, however, was far from over.

While Axel Fox got entangled with Mister Z, Goblin focused on Olgierd, who vowed to end Goblin and make him "his bitch".

#### Teases of break-up

After Fox lost to Mister Z at [Hardcore Friday: Barszcz z Krzesłami](e/ppw/2024-12-06-ppw-hardcore-friday-barszcz-z-krzeslami.md), his frustration was growing. In a lead-up to [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), Mister Z offered Axel a chance to join him (and Zmowa) to achieve success, instead of allying himself with "losers" such as Goblin. At the show itself, Axel confronted Z, flanked by Legia Łysych, emphatically declining the offer and remaining a babyface. This prompted Zmowa to punish him with a three-on-one beatdown - but the odds were quickly evened, as Axel was saved by The Hardcores ([Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md)). This led to an impromptu six-man match which the babyface team won, with a little help from Goblin who dragged Olgierd away on a leash.

At the same show, Goblin was pitted by Zmowa against three opponents ([Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md)) in a Gauntlet match. In the event of a loss, he would be sent to a mandatory drug rehabilitation at Monar. Goblin retained his freedom.

At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md), Goblin was put in another one of Zmowa's challenges - a _Sorpresa de Lucha Muy Loco_, where he defeated luchador Sentinel via submission. Axel Fox challenged and beat two of the ex-rookies of Ewenement Dojo - [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) and rookie [Bartosz](@/w/plata.md). At the end of the show, Goblin ruined Olgierd's celebration of defeating all the PpW referees, put him in a dog collar and chained him to a turnbuckle.

At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md), Goblin finally faced his nemesis Olgierd, losing a Dog Collar Match, after nearly getting hanged.
Fox himself participated as one of the competitors in 20 Typa 20 Broni Rumble Match to gain an opportunity for a Title Match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md). He started the match first, promising to win it as an _Iron Man_. Fox lasted until the final two, but the last opponent turned out to be Goblin, miraculously recovered after his near-death from Olgierd's hands. Goblin threw Fox over the top rope, securing the title shot and putting another strain on their friendship. During post-show interviews Legia Łysych attacked Fox, while Goblin was celebrating his victory in other parts of the arena. This led Fox to question Goblin's loyalty, reiterating the question he once asked Justin Joy: _Can Axel trust Goblin?_ 
With the team not on the same page, they were put in a Tornado Tag Team match against Legia Łysych set for the [next show](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md). The differences were settled, the match was won, but their celebration was cut short by a rampaging Gustav Gryffin.

From that point on a tag team efforts were put on hold, since Goblin focused on his war with Gryffin and - after winning it - defending his [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), and Fox still continued his war against [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md).
