[Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) were a tag team active in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) between 2016 and 2020. In 2018 they became the first [KPW Tag Team Champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md), their reign lasting a total of 455 days.

## History

The two wrestlers initially started in solos competition, and were first paired in 2017, winning a match against [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md) and [Mateusz Kowalski](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md).
At [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11.md) they took part in the inaugural Tag Team Championship tournament. In the second round, they were scheduled to face a team of fellow [Kawaleria](@/tt/kawaleria.md) members, [PiÄ™kny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) and [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), but their opponents were disqualified for being under the influence, effectively granting them a bye into the finals.

As Tag Team Champions, they defended the belts at Arenas [13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md) and [14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md), and at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md), before losing the titles to [The Hunt](@/tt/the-hunt.md) at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md).

After their defeat Rosetti turned on his partner, ending the team. While Rosetti remained with KPW, Sawicki later associated himself with [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), training and promoting them on social media, but did not make even a single appearance before retiring.
