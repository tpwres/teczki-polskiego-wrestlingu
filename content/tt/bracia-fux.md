Bracia Fux are a Polish tag team consisting of [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) and [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md). They are best known for their work in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) and [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md).

## History

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-present)

[Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) and [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) made their debuts at [KPW Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md). Working as a tag team called Bracia Fux (_the Fux Brothers_), the two kayfabe siblings faced a one-off team of [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) and [Piotr Opolski](@/w/piotr-opolski.md), whom they defeated. The [next show](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md) saw them in another tag match, but the two Fuxes quickly branched off into singles competition starting with [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19.md). Since then they have appeared solo as well as together in roughly equal measure.

#### Championship pursuits

At [Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) the Brothers took part in a [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) 4-Way Elimination Match against three other teams, but lost. At the following show, [Arena 20](@/e/kpw/2022-12-16-kpw-arena-20.md), they faced the new Tag Team Champions, [Die Ordnung](@/tt/die-ordnung.md), but with no success. Their moment came a year later at [Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) when they clashed with the German team once again, this time stripping them of their titles. This victory was followed by a series of defences against the likes of [Gałąź Gregoriańska](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md) ([Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) & [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md)) and The 87 (Alexander Roth & Roy Johnson). Eventually, at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md), the Brothers lost their titles to [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md) ([David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) & [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md)).

At [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) the Brothers took part in a tournament for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) Contendership and at the [next show](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md) they faced [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) as well as one another in a Three Way Match - a bout that was won by Michał Fux. Then at [Arena 28](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) Michał took on [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) in a match for KPW's main title, while Filip squared off against Chemik for his [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md); however, both Fuxes lost their matches.

At [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) the Fux Brothers were challenged by [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md) for their KPW Tag Team Championships. Shockingly, the challangers were able to defeat the Champions, ending their reign after 735 days. Soon after, at [KPW's Show in Kadzidło](@/e/kpw/2025-09-06-kpw-kadzidlo.md), they introduced a third brother, Oskar Fux, a worker who made his debut as an unnamed rookie during a match against [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) at Godzina Zero. As of the early October 2025, it is unknown if the Oskar Fux character will be utilised in regular KPW's programming, which leaves him as a non-canon character.

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025-)

At [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) Filip lost a match against [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), who - along with his tag team partner [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - expressed interest in Filip's KPW Tag Team title. The [follow-up event](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) then saw a match between Bracia Fux and [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) for the Tag Team titles. Once again, the Brothers retained their gold.

## International wrestling appearances

In addition to working in Poland, the Fux Brothers made an appearance in 2023 for the Austrian promotion European Wrestling Association. They went against Team Energy (Chris Colen & Damon Brix) for their EWA Tag Team championship, but failed to win the belts.
