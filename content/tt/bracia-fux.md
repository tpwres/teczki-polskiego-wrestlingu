## History

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2021-)

[Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) and [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) made their debuts at [KPW Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md). Working as a tag team called Bracia Fux (_the Fux Brothers_), the two kayfabe siblings faced a one-off team of [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) and [Piotr Opolski](@/w/piotr-opolski.md), whom they defeated. The [next show](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md) saw them in another tag match, but the two Fuxes quickly branched off into singles competition starting with [Arena 19](@/e/kpw/2022-06-10-kpw-arena-19.md). Since then they have appeared solo as well as together in roughly equal measure.

#### Championship pursuits

At [Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) the Brothers took part in a [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) 4-Way Elimination Match against three other teams, but lost. At the following show, [Arena 20](@/e/kpw/2022-12-16-kpw-arena-20.md), they faced the new Tag Team Champions, [Die Ordnung](@/tt/die-ordnung.md), but with no success. Their moment came a year later at [Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) when they clashed with the German team once again, this time stripping them of their titles. This victory was followed by a series of defences against the likes of [Gałąź Gregoriańska](@/tt/galaz-gregorianska.md) ([Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) & [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md)) and The 87 (Alexander Roth & Roy Johnson).

At [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) the Brothers took part in a tournament for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) Contendership and at the [next show](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md) they faced [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) as well as one another in a Three Way Match - a bout that was won by Michał Fux. Then at [Arena 28](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) Michał took on [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) in a match for KPW's main title, while Filip squared off against Chemik for his [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md); however, both Fuxes lost their matches.

### International venture (2023)

In addition to working in Poland, the Fux Brothers made an appearance in 2023 for the Austrian promotion European Wrestling Association. They went against Team Energy (Chris Colen & Damon Brix) for their EWA Tag Team championship, but failed to win the belts. 

### Legacy of Wrestling (2025-)

At [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) Filip lost a match against [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), who - along with his tag team partner [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - expressed interest in Filip's KPW Tag Team title. The [follow-up event](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) then saw a match between Bracia Fux and [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) for the Tag Team titles. Once again, the Brothers retained their gold.
