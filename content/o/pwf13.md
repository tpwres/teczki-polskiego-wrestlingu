Polish Wrestling Federation was a short-lived backyard federation active from January to May 2013. It was most probably active in a town of Żyrardów.

## History

Not much is known about Polish Wrestling Federation due to its rather short lifespan. The first known Internet entry about this backyard comes from an May 4th, 2013 post made on WrestleFans forum. According to one of PWF owners known as "Mixcer20", the federation was created in January 2013, and they were aware of fact, that their brand-new federation holds the same name as another [PWF active in 2007](@/o/pwf07.md). Mixcer20 announced the roster name - The Next Generation - and announced that they will publish their first show until end of May. The first "PPV" was supposed to be named "Best of the Best". 

Federation owned their website where they provided public with information about federation. From the avaliable data it is known that roster consisted of: Ace, Angel Del Oro, The Assassin, Big G, CJ Cass, Chris Mistery, Dave Brown, The Dead Devil, Diego Martinez, Fighter, Goldman, Liner, Martin Silva & Mr. Plankton. It is also known that backyard federation runned their wrestling shows on playground with a plan to construct a ring.

Public activity of federation lasted less than a month, as it went silent after publishing their last update at their website on 24th of May, 2014 most probably without ever releasing any show to the public, or deleting it after some time.

## Championships

According to information on PWF website federation planned on hosting two tournaments for their PWF Championship at "Best of the Best" show. They also planned on promoting Żyrardów Championship - named after their hometown.
