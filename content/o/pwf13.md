Polish Wrestling Federation was a short-lived backyard federation active from January to May 2013. It was most likely active in a town of Żyrardów.

## History

Not much is known about Polish Wrestling Federation due to its rather short lifespan. The first known Internet entry about this backyard comes from a May 4th, 2013, post made on WrestleFans forum. According to a PWF owner known as "Mixcer20", the federation was created in January 2013, and they were aware of the fact that their brand-new federation had the same name as an unrelated [PWF active in 2007](@/o/pwf07.md). Mixcer20 announced the roster name - The Next Generation - and said that their first show would be published by the end of May. The first "PPV" was supposed to be named "Best of the Best". 

The federation had a website where they published information about their group. From the avaliable data it is known that the roster consisted of: Ace, Angel Del Oro, The Assassin, Big G, CJ Cass, Chris Mistery, Dave Brown, The Dead Devil, Diego Martinez, Fighter, Goldman, Liner, Martin Silva and Mr. Plankton. It is also known that the backyard federation ran their wrestling shows on a playground, with a plan to construct a ring.

Public activity of the federation lasted less than a month, as it went silent after publishing the last update on their website on May 24th, 2014. PWF most likely never released any shows to the public, or deleted them after some time.

## Championships

According to the information on the PWF website, the federation planned on hosting two tournaments for their PWF Championship at "Best of the Best" show. They also planned on promoting the Żyrardów Championship, named after their hometown.
