## History

### 2021-2022: Foundation and the celebrity era

PTW Academy started as a wrestling dojo directly linked to Prime Time Wrestling itself.
The first training sessions began in early 2021.
That year's class of rookies was a mix of wrestling enthusiasts, mostly from Silesia, like ex-[MCW](@/o/mcw.md) wrestlers such as Dziedzic and Sinister,
as well as micro-influencers and people convinced to try wrestling by Pawłowski, such as YouTuber TAXI Złotówa, Wiktoria Domżalska and fitness coach Sylwia Cross.
Additionally, multiple ex-[MZW](@/o/mzw.md) and [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestlers had transferred to PTW to train there, due to personal reasons and lack of consistency in training schedule after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The original plan for PTW Academy was to attract not only pro wrestling enthusiasts, but also new people unaware of wrestling culture and specifics.
Pawłowski frequently tried to attract non-wrestling celebrities to attend training sessions, but after [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), when these efforts largely failed, that strategy was abandoned and PTW Academy focused more on developing their own stars.
During that year some of the wrestlers allied themselves in a group called "the Originals", a nickname given to PTW-raised talent under the influence of Pawłowski's teachings and wrestling philosophy.
Those differences would later lead to conflicts between the Originals and other groups who came to PTW from other organizations (especially "[The Greens](@/tt/zieloni.md)") later on.

### 2022-2023: The golden era

Once the rookies' roster stabilized, PTW Academy maintained regular attendance at every training session.
Due to the unique advantage of owning two wrestling rings in the PTW Performance Center, the attendees were often split into two groups: Rookies and Journeymen (the advanced group), to provide a higher level of training.
As the federation itself was in good standing with its sponsors, the PTW Academy benefitted from that as well. The money allowed them to provide high-grade coaches (such as Justin Joy and [John Klinger](@/w/bad-bones.md)), and frequent seminaries hosted by former WWE and TNA talent such as Nick Aldis and Axel Tischer.

During this period, training sessions were held almost every weekend, with a few exceptions for the major shows.

### 2023-2024: Crisis and downsizing

After the departure of [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), the Academy lacked a regular experienced coach.
Most of the training responsibilities were taken up by Taras, Disco Pablo and Nano Lopez, with an occasional appearance from Axel Fox or Renegade.
Overall, the attendance at training weekends went slightly down due to circumstances connected directly to PTW itself.

PTW Academy, along with the federation, changed its location in April 2024, when they moved from [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md) in Chorzów to [Pod Platanem](@/v/dworek-kozlow.md) in Kozłów, a village bordering Gliwice.
During the massive wave of [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md) following [PTW #6: Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), a significant part of coaching staff, talent and rookies left the federation.
