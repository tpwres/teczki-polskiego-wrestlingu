Pomerania Indy Wrestling Group was one of the first Polish backyard wrestling promotions. PIWG was founded by Kamil Manuszewski under the ring name The Seraphim (who later became known as [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md)), who was also the only trainer. The group began in Skórcz, before moving to Starogard Gdański and finally to Gdańsk. All of these cities are located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, hence the name.

## History

PIWG officially started in August 2007, however they held trainings as early as spring 2005. Since PIWG didn't have a ring, they trained and performed on mattresses covered with a tarp, and even a desk, set in a garden. In January 2008 PIWG managed to book a school gym, allowing for more regular trainings and tapings. The gym was available for free during summer vacation, courtesty of the school's principal, however the group (who broke the gym's every regulation) had to avoid an over-zelous janitor by pretending to play basketball, lest she snitched on them to the principal. Nobody in PIWG had ever trained any combat sports.

According to Kamil, PIWG had guest performers from other Polish cities, such as Kraków and Szczecin, and even got some positive feedback from Germany and USA. PIWG is probably best known for being the place where people like Kamil Aleksander or [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) first tried wrestling.

PIWG have since deleted their videos from YouTube, so the only few surviving materials are reuploads by other people. According to a [list of published videos][atti-wydane-filmiki] posted to Attitude Forum by Kamil, the earliest PIWG shows (held on unknown dates) were called PIWG Without Fear and PIWG Goes Hardcore. In 2009, PIWG was eventually shut down after owner and coach left to join [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).

In addition to the people listed in the Roster section below, there were also: Andrzej, Dominguezz, Evolution, Hellraiser, Scizor, Shogun and Soldat. One source claims that [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) also used to fight in PIWG, however this information could not be corroborated and is likely a mistake. 

## Championships 

It is known that at [Storm Over Pomerania](@/e/piwg/2008-08-10-piwg-storm-over-pomerania.md) the federation introduced the PIWG Pomerania Championship, which was won by Seraphim. He is the only known champion in the federation's history.
