Prime Time Wrestling is a Polish wrestling organisation founded in 2021 in Silesia. Initially operating at Chorzów, PTW later moved to a nearby village of Kozłów.

## History

### The 2021 launch

On June 28, 2021, [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), an experienced, yet polarizing figure on the Polish scene, announced the launch of his own wrestling promotion, promising "a new quality of entertainment".
He posted a [trailer][trailer-1-ptw] featuring himself and glimpses of various wrestlers.
Over the course of the summer, training events have been held and social media promotion continued.
Eventually, the organization announced it was going to hold their first official event in October (preceded by a smaller show closed to the public), and revealed the booked wrestlers.
These were both veterans of the Polish scene, as well as debuting Polish wrestlers and foreign guests.

#### The first show

This first show, titled [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), was met with positive response, even though some aspects were criticised.
Fans praised the starpower, production value and overall high-budget feel.
The criticism was focused on Pawłowski's character, who fans felt was overexposed, inviting influencers to hype up the show, blatantly aggressive sponsor ads, and the booking - with a significant imbalance of starpower and a DQ finish in the main event.
Most of the Polish talent on that show became cornerstones of PTW's roster, while some notably flopped.
TV personality and freak fighter Paweł "Trybson" Trybała, initially strongly booked as a non-wrestler entering the business, failed to ever make his PTW return.

The successful event was quickly followed by PTW announcing their Underground shows. The [first one](@/e/ptw/2021-12-19-ptw-underground-1.md) was held in the [PTW Performance Center](@/v/ptw-targowa.md) in Chorzów.
It kicked off a near-monthly series of events in 2022 and 2023: an Underground show on the last Sunday of each month, except when that weekend was already booked for the bigger (numbered) events.
Underground shows advanced storylines seen in these bigger events, but with significantly less starpower.
While initially only available to the live public, since Underground 4 they were also streamed live, first on FITE/TrillerTV and later YouTube as well.
The venue had limited capacity, which was cleverly used to make these events feel more exclusive, only for the most dedicated fans.

### 2022

Continuing their strong entry into the scene, PTW started the year with the [second Underground show](@/e/ptw/2022-01-23-ptw-underground-2.md)
and quickly followed with [PTW #2: Blackout](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md), which was also well received.
This show had even more starpower than Revolucja, featuring debuts of well-known names like [Joe Hendry](@/w/joe-hendry.md), [Marty Scurll](@/w/marty-scurll.md), Matt Sydal and [John "Bad Bones" Klinger](@/w/bad-bones.md).

Over the course of the year, PTW continued its steady pace, presenting the monthly Underground shows, and debuting at [Ryucon](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md), a manga-themed fan convention in Kraków.
The third major show, [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), was the first one to be held outside Chorzów, in Warsaw.
Among other notable moments, it featured the first PTW women's match (outside the exclusive Underground shows), where [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) competed against two former NXT-UK wrestlers, Xia Brookside and Myla Grace.
Also at this show, the IMPACT Digital Media Championship was defended, and [Santino](@/w/santino.md) was named the kayfabe co-owner of PTW, leading to a long-standing feud between Bad Bones & Longman vs Pawłowski.
This show became part of a double-header weekend: on the day before, Warsaw's [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) hosted their own event,
named [Najlepsza Gala w Mieście](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) (_The Best Event In Town_). This was seen as PpW playfully taking potshots at the rival organization.
_Legends_ closed 2022 as PTW's last show of such ambition and scale, until 2024's [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md).

### 2023

#### Sponsorship dropped, name change

Prior to the first event, on 21st of September 2021, Kinguin was announced as one of the [sponsors][sponsors-announcement], later becoming the titular sponsor, and was added to the promotion's logo.
Kinguin is a marketplace selling digital items, primarily game keys and in-game currency.
The Kinguin mascot became a regular part of the shows, and was even included in an angle with Taxi Złotówa at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md).

Though Kinguin's departure was never officially announced, the titular sponsor was gradually dropped from PTW's branding over the spring/summer of 2023.
The last Facebook post featuring Kinguin PTW name was from 26th March 2023, a [cover photo change][cover-photo-underground14] announcing [Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md).
Afterwards, none of the graphics for the show featured Kinguin in either logo or name.

#### Fourth major show

After closing 2022 with Legends, PTW continued to hold Underground shows.
Throughout the first half of the year, they continued at a monthly pace (except for January, which saw a double-header Underground weekend).
On June 25th in Wrocław, PTW held their 4th major show overall and the only one for 2023 - [The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md).
This event saw the crowning of [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md) as the inaugural PTW Tag Team Champions, a storyline involving [Bad Bones](@/w/bad-bones.md) kidnapping Marcin Rzeźniczek, and the formation of what would later become [The Sinister Kingdom](@/tt/sinister-kingdom.md).
Foreign starpower was significantly lower than in previous major shows, presumably due to titular sponsor dropping out.
This was also the first major PTW show to be put behind a paywall (the supporter functionality of YouTube; the first fight was available for free), with the live stream dropping out so often that it rendered the show unwatchable.
All these issues caused a lot of controversy, angering the fans who were demanding refunds - which PTW later granted in the form of free tickets and discounts for PTW's merchandise.

#### Crisis and departures

_See also: [PTW Exits: 2023](@/a/ptw-exits.md#2023-mystery)._

After voicing their frustrations on social media, [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Samson](@/w/samson.md) were all removed from PTW's roster (see Justin's page for a series of screenshots from his social media where he addressed the situation).

In the beginning of 2024, [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) was also quietly removed from the roster page.
[Robert Star's](@/w/robert-star.md) departure went unannounced by the promotion, with his profile removed at some point between January and March 2024.

On February 12th, 2024, PTW commentary team member [Piotr "ShowOff" Małecki](@/w/piotr-malecki.md) announced an indefinite leave from PTW, citing burnout as a reason. Gradually, he severed his ties with the organization, first changing his Twitter/X bio entry to "ex-PTW commentator", and becoming increasingly critical towards the promotion.

#### Expansion into Austria

Throughout 2023, [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md), in addition to his in-ring career in PTW, launched a wrestling promotion of his own: Wrestling World Austria (WWA).
The first set of tapings was announced for September 29th, 2023, to take place in City Theater in Hallein, Austria. Among others, the show featured multiple talent from PTW.

On December 4th, 2023, both PTW and WWA [announced][wwa-announcement] that WWA had now become a part of PTW.
The initial name for the this merged promotion was "PTW: WWA" (also stylized as "PTW presents: WWA"), but the organization soon adopted "PTW Germany" as their [social media name](https://www.facebook.com/ptwwrestlingdeutsch). In addition to covering their own shows, this account reposted PTW's updates concerning events in Poland, but translated to German. However, since the latest batch of tapings to date, in October 2024, their social media have remained mostly silent.

### 2024

In February 2024, PTW held their fifth major event: [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), this time in Częstochowa, a city in the northern Silesian voivodship.
The Underground shows were also moved to a new location. Initially announced as Gliwice, a historical city in the west of the Silesian metropolis, the actual location turned to be a venue in the neighboring village of Kozłów, about 9&nbsp;km west of the city.
This made the Underground shows far less accessible, and sparked some criticism.
They also lost their regularity, with [only one](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) being announced for April.
That event was followed by [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) in May.

#### Pawłowski's solo run

On Monday, March 11th 2024, Marcin "Rzeźnik" Rzeźniczek, co-owner of PTW, officially confirmed on his social media that he left PTW and Pawłowski remains the sole owner. Breaking kayfabe (a recent storyline from [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) revealed him as the mastermind behind [Bad Bones](@/w/bad-bones.md) and [Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) shenanigans), he wished his former partner, and everyone in PTW, the best of luck conquering the Polish and world wrestling scenes, and fondly recalled his time in PTW.

#### New YouTube show: "Gruby temat"

In March 2024, PTW launched a new format on YouTube, titled "Gruby Temat" (_Fat Topic_ - jokingly referring to Pawłowski's rather large size), with Pawłowski and Kacper "Ludwiczek" Bociański as hosts, and one special guest for each episode. While Ludwiczek was not previously affiliated with wrestling, he was an MMA fighter on Poland's freak fight scene.
The first guest of this new show was Marcel Gawroński, a popular TikToker who covers Poland's freak fight scene.
Another episode featured PTW's own [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), while Polish boxer and UFC women's champion Joanna Jędrzejczyk was the guest in episode 3.
The format of this show was mostly an interview with the guest, including questions from the audience asked via chat.

#### The lottery

At the Gold Rush event, Pawłowski revealed a new promotional scheme for PTW: a 2012 Nissan GTR car, the grand prize to be won in a lottery. To circumvent the legal age requirement, lottery tickets were not sold directly. Instead, fans were encouraged to purchase e-books, which came with a free ticket. These e-books were short PDF documents (e.g. "[PTW Revolucja](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md)" at 17 pages), including results from PTW shows, photos and a short narrative. It was apparent that they were not supposed to provide any useful content, but rather serve as a legal means for distributing lottery tickets. The car was claimed to be worth 600.000&nbsp;PLN, or about 140.000&nbsp;EUR, 166.000&nbsp;USD or 123.000&nbsp;GBP at the time.

In the following months leading to [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) and [PTW #6: Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), Pawłowski promoted the lottery heavily on social media and in collaboration with various online personalities, most of whom had no prior connection with wrestling; one such personality was Ludwiczek, the co-host of Gruby Temat at that time.
Immediately after Underground 21, PTW's social media accounts continued to focus solely on the lottery, while promoting the next major show took a distant second place, restricted to revealing the card in a series of posts.
The organization cared so little for promoting its own show that it did not even try managing the accidental reveal of the full match card, which was leaked on the WrestleFans forum before PTW revealed the final match themselves.
The leak was accidentally posted by a WrestleFans newsman Piotr "Sabinq" Gilewski. [Taras](@/w/taras.md) called him out on the mistake on Twitter/X, and in turn revealed that he also was on a lengthy break from PTW, although officially he was not released yet.

#### The prize draw

On Sunday, May 12th, PTW held the lottery's prize draw on a YouTube live stream.
Despite PTW's stated goal of providing entertainment for the whole family, this show included controversial guests: Stonoga (a notorious Polish businessman and whistleblower) and the cast of _Królowe Życia_ ("The Queens of Life") reality show, spouting distasteful, sexually-charged jokes.
The lottery's overseeing committee was never shown by the cameras. The lottery failed to achieve its desired goal of popularising PTW - some prize winners, who were called on the phone live as per the lottery's regulations, had no idea who called them and why, and did not recognize the names Pawłowski or PTW. After it was finished, the prize draw show quickly went private on YouTube, and other lottery-related materials started to disappear from the Internet (eventually including the lottery website).

#### Crisis following Total Blast From The Past

_Main article: [PTW's 2024 crisis](@/a/ptw-crisis.md)_

Between the two major shows in 2024, PTW lost a lot of credibility among wrestling fans, and saw many of its talent leave, dissatisfied with the organization and losing faith in the product.
This was caused by the failures of their new marketing strategy, seemingly distancing itself from wrestling as the core product, and betting heavily on influencer appeal instead.

#### More high-profile exits

_See also: [PTW Exits: 2024](@/a/ptw-exits.md#2024-gold-rush-and-total-blast-from-the-past)._

Right after PTW #6, long-time PTW commentator [Arkadiusz Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) confirmed his departure in a [tweet][paterek-tweet].
Two weeks later, on a YouTube live stream, commentator [Łukasz Baliński](@/w/lukasz-balinski.md) also announced his resignation.

On May 31st, PTW wrestler [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) appeared on the [first episode][dziedzic-ngz] of "No Gimmick Zone", discussing various backstage topics in a shoot-style interview. This led to rumors of his release just two days later, which was confirmed by Dziedzic announcing his departure from PTW that same week.

After some teasing on his Instagram Stories, Sinister confirmed the speculations as well. On Wednesday, June 5th 2024, he shared a [farewell post][sinister-farewell-insta] of his own.
Shortly after that, referee Seweryn also confirmed his departure in his Instagram story.

On June 6th [Boro](@/w/boro.md) added a set of stories on Instagram, titled "PTW Last Dance", which was an obvious farewell.

Michał "Mutant" Świątkowski, an inactive PTW wrestler who was shelved just after his return at Gold Rush, seemingly confirmed his exit through Instagram stories.

On June 8th, [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md), a tag team consisting of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), who never announced leaving PTW, made their surprise debut for [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md).

On June 9th, [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) posted a [black and white photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7_u3gIsgSO/) of himself and his valet [Rusałka](@/w/rusalka.md) on his Instagram profile. This was also interpreted as his exit from PTW.

On Thursday June 13th, PTW have taken down the roster section of their page.

In a [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2180575222) on June 25th Pawłowski confirmed that [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), a popular babyface, had also quit the organization. This was the first time this info was shared, as Axel himself had not revealed it before. Just a month later Fox joined [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), becoming one of the coaches in PpW's rebranded [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md).

#### Soft reboot: Ryucon, new co-owner

Breaking the silence, Pawłowski promised that the [Ryucon show](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md) would be a new opening for PTW.
The non-televised event included many new faces, both from [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) and foreign free agents.
During the show, [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), the owner of [Dworek Pod Platanem](@/v/dworek-kozlow.md) where [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) was held, was announced as PTW's new co-owner.
This change was not reflected in official registration documents (as of August 21, 2024), where Pawłowski remains the sole shareholder and director of PTW's commercial entity, and the sole board member of PTW's other legal entity, a non-profit association.
Nevertheless, Okoński's increased involvement was noticeable, as he was actively promoting PTW on social media. Renamed Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński, he gradually increased his presence, appearing on virtually every show and taking part in segments.

On August 14, 2024, PTW launched their new show, "Czas na Wrestling" (_Time for Wrestling_) on a local Silesian TV station, TVT. It is hosted by Pawłowski, who typically interviews a single PTW roster/personnel member, talking various wrestling/PTW related topics and plugging future shows. Some of the episodes are hosted by TVT on their [web page][czas-na-wrestling]. The first episode featured a panel where Pawłowski led the discussion with two guests: Łukasz Okoński, who commented on his increased involvement, and [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) who was asked mostly about the technical aspects of wrestling.

#### Post-Ryucon: New venue, PTW back on track

PTW's third [Ryucon](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md) also saw the announcement of PTW Summer Camp, culminating with [another show](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md), once again held in [Kozłów](@/v/dworek-kozlow.md), which now appeared to be PTW's new base of operations.

In September, PTW held their first ever charity show, [Walczymy Dla Fundacji](@/e/ptw/2024-09-29-ptw-walczymy-dla-fundacji.md). More Undergrounds for every remaining month of 2024 have been scheduled, although the shows are not aired live as previously, but rather taped with a promise of later release.
Once again, PTW returned the format of [live Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1vSrWODqfM) for YouTube supporters. The revamped show saw [Krystian "Resivny" Smoleń](@/w/resivny.md) replacing ShowOff as the host. Resivny was also confirmed to be the third member of the new commentary team.

On 17.10.2024 PTW [announced][fb-extreme-sports] that their shows would air on television, on Extreme Sports Channel. The first show to air would be [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), set to broadcast on 27.10.2024.

#### End of Underground series, Pawłowski's heel run

[Underground 25](e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25/) saw two seismic shifts. In the opening segment, Pawłowski confirmed that the show would be the final PTW Underground. To commemorate this series of events, a tournament would be held where the inaugural [PTW Underground Champion](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) would be crowned.

In the main event, featuring [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) defending his [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) against [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), Pawłowski shocked the audience by attacking Spartan with a chair, which allowed Puncher to retain - thus turning heel for the first time since his [DDW](@/o/ddw.md) run. Ever since, Pawłowski has dropped his gracious persona and heavily increased his social media presence, going into arguments with "haters", whom he refers to as "basement-dwellers" (_piwniczaki_).

In another argument in the comment section of the [PTW Facebook page][kasa-okonia], Okoński clarified the extent of his involvement in the promotion, declaring he "put 350&nbsp;000 PLN (roughly 82&nbsp;000 EUR, 68&nbsp;000 GBP or 85&nbsp;000 USD) into PTW".

On 11.01.2025 PTW posted a reminder about the upcoming [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md). In one of the comments below this post a company called Event Production, responsible for the production of [Total Blast from the Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), wrote "As a part of the new order, can we count on settling the old debts?", suggesting that PTW still owes them money for their last big show. A fan responded to their post saying that PTW is penniless and sells very few tickets. In the ensuing discussion, Pawłowski and Okoński declared that PTW is in a good condition financially. The event company confirmed that they produced [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) as well.

Over the following months, PTW continued to hold the shows regularly, staying in Kozłów as their base of operations. Since Okoński's December in-ring debut, he kept being presented as the face chairman, protecting babyfaces from Pawłowski's bullying. "Chairman vs chairman" became a focal point of the storylines, set to culminate at the [appropriately named show](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md) in April. The match between two chairmen turned out to be a set-up from Pawłowski, so the story continued.

PTW increased the number of their championships: [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) was crowned the inaugural [PTW Underground Champion](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), and a tournament was started to crown the inaugural [PTW Women's Champion](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md).

In multiple Q&A sessions Pawłowski alluded that their next non-domestic show would be at Ryucon 2025. However, Ryucon eventually decided to host another federation and the supposed PTW show became [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md).

### 2025

Following the upheaval of 2024, things have largely settled down in the following year. The promotion commited to the scaled-down format of smaller monthly shows, all in the same location of [Szafirowy Dwór](@/v/dworek-kozlow.md) in Kozłów.

The year saw the debuts of many international wrestlers, such as [El G](@/w/el-g.md) and Ricky Eagle from Italy, Team Turbulence (Tommy Tornado & Tommy Torpedo), Andi ZickZack, Flex Skywalker and Nic Wesker from Austria, Lucy Couture from England, and most prominently, [Mercedes Moné](@/w/mercedes-mone.md) from the USA. Mercedes made an appearance at [All About the Moné](@/e/ptw/2025-07-27-ptw-all-about-the-mone.md), a show that was announced only eight days in advance. She faced [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) in the main event, a match for the BestYa Women's Championship and the [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md). Moné won the match, becoming the first PTW Women's Champion. She later appeared with the belts at AEW Forbidden Door in London, as well as on AEW weekly TV back in the US.

A number of new Polish wrestlers made their debuts: [Polski Niedźwiedź](@/w/polski-niedzwiedz.md), [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md), [Daniel Razor](@/w/daniel-razor.md) and CJ Klakson (a former [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) trainee), in addition to a new commentary team of [Adam Goldschmidt](@/w/adam-goldschmidt.md) and [Krystian Smoleń](@/w/resivny.md). Additionally, [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) made his first appearance in the PTW ring at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md), five years after joining the federation.

On the other hand, the reigning [PTW Underground Champion](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) was fired from PTW for choosing to appear at [Legacy of Wrestling vol. 3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md), and his title was vacated. The [next event](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md) saw [Daniel Razor](@/w/daniel-razor.md) become the new Underground Champion.

On the international front, the Austrian sister promotion PTW:WWA has effectively closed down. [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md), WWA's owner, remained on good terms with PTW and appeared at a couple of shows. At the same time, PTW established cooperation with the Italian promotion BestYa Slam.

## Polish wrestling scene

PTW's initial roster was built from wrestlers previously appearing in [MZW](@/o/mzw.md), [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), [MCW](@/o/mcw.md) and [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), however PTW itself is known for its lack of interaction with other federations in Poland.
Talent were strictly prohibited from appearing in any other Polish rings, and any form of cooperation, either as a performer or in a backstage role, resulted in "firing" from PTW.
One early example of that is [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), ostensibly fired for "damaging the organization's image".
That fact was one of the key factors leading to most of the [PTW exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md), where the talent wanted to have more freedom and be able to take bookings from other Polish organizations.
This is similar to KPW's pre-[2024](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) approach. Fans theorise that this isolationist attitude was inherited from [Don Roid's](@/w/don-roid.md) [DDW](@/o/ddw.md), where Pawłowski learned the ropes. Their attitude towards "backyards" like [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) is also shared with KPW and MZW.

Pawłowski made an appearance on Marcin Najman's "Oryginalne Zero" YouTube channel in a video titled ["The Whole Truth About Polish Wrestling"][pawłowski-najman-zero], which prompted further controversy on the Polish scene. Asked if he's the only wrestling promoter in Poland, Pawłowski claimed that he is the only professional one, acknowledging the competition but calling them "more or less amateur projects". This prompted an impassioned response from the ex-wrestler and current [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) promoter [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), who made a lengthy Facebook post addressing the remarks. Kawaler claimed that Pawłowski was fired from KPW due to being a self-centered mark, focusing on promoting his own persona instead of team effort. He said that the current state of PTW is more resembling of a backyard than a professional wrestling federation. The post got a lot of agreeing comments and reactions from Polish wrestlers and wrestling personnel, current and former, from all sides of the Polish scene: [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md), [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), [Boro](@/w/boro.md), [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md), [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md), [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md), [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md), [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md), [Samson](@/w/samson.md), [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md), [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Taras](@/w/taras.md), [Krzysztof Zasada](@/w/krzysztof-zasada.md), [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md), [Iskra](@/w/iskra.md), [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md), [Arek Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md), [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md), [Łukasz Baliński](@/w/lukasz-balinski.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md), [Piotr Opolski](@/w/piotr-opolski.md), [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md), [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md), [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md).

In a [live interview][pawłowski-my-wrestling-live] for MyWrestling, Pawłowski doubled down on his statements. He responded to Piękny Kawaler, revealing some dirt on him, calling him a pussy, ridiculing his height and lack of courage. According to Pawłowski, Kawaler had always wanted to downsize KPW, because larger shows would equal more work. He also accused Kawaler of being unstable and carrying a gun to fend off imaginary goons sent by Pawłowski. Pawłowski stated that Kawaler minimised Pawłowski's involvement in the promotion by reducing his role to just hosting shows and announcing fights. This led to an increasing disagreement between Pawłowski and Kawaler, so Pawłowski tried to sever ties with KPW as amicably as possible, however Kawaler blindsided him by firing Pawłowski just a day before his scheduled appearance at [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14.md). Despite this, Pawłowski started his new promotion in Silesia to avoid directly competing with KPW. He reiterated his belief that PTW is the first Polish professional promotion and their competition is more or less amateurish. In hindsight he also does not see KPW and DDW as pro, though he admitted that he'd seen these projects as professional at the time he was involved.

Asked about overdue payments for [Total Blast From the Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), which saw many competitors leave soon thereafter, Pawłowski changed his narrative about PTW's debts. In his prior appearance for Kanał Zero he'd promised to pay off all the debts that PTW has. Now he alleged there were never any debts, except for PTW ex-wrestlers owing the promotion money for trainings. However, he chose to graciously absolve them of these debts to avoid any further contact with them.

Asked about [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), he claimed there were no attempts to invite PTW competitors. Multiple insiders in the chat confirmed otherwise, so Pawłowski proceeded to explain that the only way to invite a PTW wrestler to other show is through the promoter, as they are contracted performers. When asked by a person in the chat whether "El Homo" led on a chain by a half-naked woman at [Underground 25](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md) was in line with the family friendly approach chosen by PTW, he responded that this was entirely [Prezes Okoński's](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) idea, which Pawłowski didn't fully like, but it did achieve the goal of getting people talking. He promptly followed this by stating that he'd wish PTW fans weren't idiots (_debile_), because then they'd be able to "make cool, intelligent content for cool, intelligent people".

## Foreign relations

One of the main selling points of PTW, differentiating them from their competition, were sponsors, an actual budget and the ability to bring in a lot of pro wrestlers from abroad.

At [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) it was announced that [Santino Marella](@/w/santino.md), former long-time WWE star, would become one of the organization's co-owners.
This, however, was only a short-lived storyline angle lacking any real payoff, leaving fans confused when Santino made his return at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) only as an English-language commentator, and suprise entrant in the Gold Rush Rumble. On 17.10.2025, PTW's "third owner", was [announced][santino-seminar] for a seminar on November 3th, mainly targeted towards PTW wrestlers and trainees, but also open to the public (with a minimum of in-ring training required).

In 2022, PTW entered into collaboration with Austrian wrestler [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md) and his new organization, World Wrestling Austria.
It was quickly renamed to _PTW:WWA_ and became a de facto "sister federation" ran by Krampus with assistance from Pawłowski.
This cooperation allowed PTW talent to be booked at the two PTW: WWA shows in late 2023 and early 2024, before the Austrian federation folded. In 2025 Krampus returned to the promotion, bringing in some Austrian talent, but this time without WWA banner.
(See the [Expansion into Austria](#expansion-into-austria) section above.)

PTW also struck a deal with British Wrestling Revolution (BWR), which allowed BWR Champion [Scotty Rawk](@/w/scotty-rawk.md) to defend his championship in PTW. In return, [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) were booked for one of BWR's shows in the UK. These appearances never came to fruition, however Puncher confirmed in a [livestream][live-istota-puncher] by Istota Wrestlingu that the deal was still on.

In the early September 2024, PTW announced they'd be sending a team of wrestlers to _Botte da BestYa 2_, an event by the Italian organization ICW happening on September 15, 2024. This team consisted of foreign wrestlers Iva Kolasky and Luca Bjorn, plus Polish PTW talent [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), who defended his championship. Later in 2025 this turned into a tighter cooperation with a new Italian promotion named BestYa Wrestling, with talent continuing to appear in Poland.

One remarkable deal between PTW and a bigger promotion was an agreement with Impact Wrestling for Joe Hendry to defend his Digital Media Championship against Trent Seven at [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) in 2022.

## Other media

PTW's talent made an appearance in Young Multi's [video][young-multi-ak47] for the song "AK47".
The video features Pawłowski giving a pep-talk to Multi and his band, as well as scenes of PTW wrestlers hitting their moves in the ring, intercut with clips of the band.
Pawłowski is credited as the director of fighting scenes, which were recorded in Kozłów, where their new [Performance Center](#Post-Ryucon-New-venue-PTW-back-on-track) is located.
Featured in the video are [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) and [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md).

On 2.07.2025 fans noticed that the official PTW website was replaced with a generic placeholder site no later than on 17.06.2025 (according to dates of posts in the Blog section), suggesting that the domain was taken over by cybersquatters after not being renewed by the promotion.
