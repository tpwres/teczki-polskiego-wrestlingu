## History

### The 2021 launch

On June 28, 2021, Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski, an experienced, yet polarizing figure on the Polish scene, announced the launch of his own wrestling promotion, promising "a new quality of entertainment".
He posted a [trailer][trailer-1-ptw] featuring himself and glimpses of various wrestlers.
Over the course of the summer, training events have been held and social media promotion continued.
Eventually, the first show [PTW#1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) was announced for October that year.
Gradually, the competitors have been revealed, featuring veterans of the Polish scene, debuting Polish wrestlers and foreign guests.

### 2023 name change

Prior to the first event, on 21st of September 2021, Kinguin was announced as one of the [sponsors][sponsors-announcement], later becoming the titular sponsor, and was added to the promotion's logo.
Kinguin is a marketplace selling digital items, primarily game keys and in-game currency.
The Kinguin mascot became a regular part of the shows, and even an angle with Taxi Złotówa at [PTW#3 Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md).

Though Kinguin's departure was never officially announced, the titular sponsor was gradually dropped from PTW's branding over the spring/summer of 2023.
The last Facebook post featuring Kinguin PTW name was from 26th March 2023, a [cover photo change][cover-photo-underground14] announcing [Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md).
Afterwards, none of the graphics for the show featured Kinguin in either logo or name.

### 2023 crisis and departures

_See also: [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md).

In the aftermath of [PTW #4 Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), build-up for the 5th major show started.
Initially planned for October 2023, the show was postponed indefinitely.
During that time, multiple talents started to voice their frustration on social media.
Eventually, [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) and [Samson](@/w/samson.md) were all removed from PTW's roster. See Justin's page for a series of screenshots from his social media where he addressed the situation.
During a [shoot interview][samson-shoot-interview] for the "Wrestling Polska" YouTube channel, Samson stated that he "never earned a single penny" in PTW, that Underground shows were not paid appearances and only the "big" (numbered) events were, with the promotor urging talent to take the "barter in training fee" instead.

During a regular [live stream][supporter-stream-barter] for his YouTube supporters (video requires paid subscription), Pawłowski confirmed the accusations, stating that barter was an option, but always voluntary.
He also confirmed that PTW wrestlers are not officially contracted and their exclusivity is based on a gentlemen's agreement.
He emphasized that his goal is to make PTW a fully mainstream promotion, with wrestlers being able to earn their living just based on their PTW role, rather than an alternative, independent route with talent being able to freelance.
It was also announced that more roster cuts are to follow, especially after "Season One" is finished.

In the beginning of 2024, [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) was also quietly removed from the roster page.
[Robert Star's](@/w/robert-star.md) departure went unnanounced by the promotion, with his profile removed at some point between January and March 2024. During an [interview][robert-star-interview] for Istota Wrestlingu Youtube Channel, Robert confirmed his departure from PTW.

On February 12th, 2024, PTW commentary team member Piotr "Showoff" Małecki announced an indefinite leave from PTW, citing burnout as a reason. Gradually, he severed his ties with the organization, first changing his Twitter/X bio entry to "ex-PTW commentator", and becoming increasingly critical towards them.

### Expansion into Austria

Throughout 2023, [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md), in addition to his in ring career in PTW, launched a wrestling promotion of his own, WWA (Wrestling World Austria).
The first set of tapings was announced for September 29th 2023, emanating from City Theater in Hallein, Austria. Among others, the show featured multiple talent from PTW.
On December 4th 2023, both PTW and WWA [announced][wwa-announcement] that WWA has now become a part of PTW.

The initial name for the this merged promotion was "PTW: WWA" (also stylized as "PTW presents: WWA"), but the organization soon adopted "PTW German" as their [social media name](https://www.facebook.com/ptwwrestlingdeutsch). In addition to covering their own shows, this account reposted PTW's updates concerning events in Poland, but translated to German.

### 2024: Pawłowski's solo run

On Monday, March 11th 2024, Marcin "Rzeźnik" Rzeźniczek, co-owner of PTW, officially confirmed on his social media that he left PTW and Pawłowski remains the sole leader. Breaking kayfabe (a recent storyline from [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) revealed him as the mastermind behind Bad Bones and Longman shenanigans), he wished his former partner, and everyone in PTW the best of luck conquering the Polish and world wrestling scenes, and fondly recalled his time in PTW.

#### New YouTube show: "Gruby temat"

In March 2024, PTW launched a new format on YouTube, titled "Gruby Temat" (_Fat Topic_ - jokingly referring to Pawłowski's rather large statue). With Pawłowski and Kacper "Ludwiczek" Bociański as hosts, and one special guest for each episode. While Ludwiczek was not previously affiliated with wrestling, he was an MMA fighter on Poland's freak fight scene.
The first guest of this new show was Marcel Gawroński, a popular TikToker who covers Poland's freak fight scene.
Another episode featured PTW's own [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md), while Polish boxer and UFC women's champion Joanna Jędrzejczyk was the guest in episode 3.
The format of this show was mostly an interview with the guest, including questions from the audience asked via chat.

#### The Lottery

At the Gold Rush event, Pawłowski revealed a new promotional scheme for PTW: a 2012 Nissan GTR car, the grand prize to be won in a lottery. To circumvent the legal age requirement, lottery tickets were not sold directly. Instead, fans were encouraged to purchase an ebook, which came with a free ticket. These ebooks were short PDF documents (e.g. "[PTW Revolucja](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md)" at 16 pages), including results from PTW's shows, photos and a short narrative. It was apparent that they were not supposed to provide any useful content, but rather serve as a legal means for distributing lottery tickets. The car was claimed to be worth 600 thousand PLN, or about 140 thousand EUR at the time.

In the following months, leading to [Underground 21](@/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md) and [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) he promoted the lottery heavily on social media, and in collaboration with various online personalities, most of who had nothing to do with wrestling.
One such personality was Ludwiczek, the co-host of Gruby temat at that time.
Immediately after Underground 21, PTW's social media accounts continued to focus solely on the lottery, while promoting the next major show took a distant second place, restricting itself to revealing the card in a series of posts.
The organization cared so little for promoting its own show, that it did not even try managing WrestleFans' accidental reveal of the full match card, which was leaked before PTW revealed the final match themselves.
The leak was accidentally posted by Wrestlefans' newsman Piotr "Sabinq" Gilewski. [Taras](@/w/taras.md) called him out on the mistake on Twitter/X, and in turn revealed that he also was on a lengthy break from PTW, although officially not released yet.

#### The Stonoga controversy

On May 8th, in a move mocked by fans and PTW wrestlers alike, notorious Polish businessman and whistleblower Zbigniew Stonoga announced that he bought 1500 tickets for [PTW#6](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), and wants to distribute them for free to his supporters (who sent him money and received a numbered membership card).
The next day, Stonoga posted photos of himself and the car, as well as short clips of himself on the passenger seat.
Ludwiczek also posted a photo of himself and the controversial Stonoga in front of the car.
Later, he announced handing out 50 tickets, free and for anyone, in person, at a McDonald's restaurant in Legionowo.
This move prompted PTW wrestler Taras to seemingly cut his ties with the organization, declaring he's finally "quitting this circus".

#### Backlash

Other PTW personalities, like [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), the already-mentioned ex-commentator Piotr Małecki, and current commentator Arek Paterek also addressed the situation.
Their posts ranged from open critique to only vague references. After Pablo and Taras made their comments, fans speculated about Pablo leaving PTW as well, which Pablo strongly denied.
Some fans also alleged that Taras' current frustration was a result of losing the PTW Tag Team Championship, which he also denied.

The two wrestlers' criticism of PTW was also met with backlash. On PTW's public Facebook group, an account named Jakub Tyczyński (presumably a PTW personality, current or former) accused them of using their good relations with Pawłowski against other wrestlers in the past, and trying to play martyrs now.

This string of PR flops, and apparent disinterest from PTW prompted Wrestlefans to pull out of promoting PTW with immediate effect, only 3 days before the show. And in another unexpected turn of events, some of the fans who received tickets from Stonoga turned ot to be [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) personnel. This got them both a free ticket for the show, and some social media exposure, through photos and live video which Stonoga, unfamiliar with the wrestling scene, shared.

During this time, PTW remained silent, attempted to control the situation by deleting comments pertaining to the Stonoga situation from the fan group, and continuing to promote... the lottery.

#### The prize draw

On Sunday, May 12th, PTW held the lottery's prize draw, as a live-stream on YouTube.
Despite PTW's stated goal to provide entertainment for the whole family, this show included controversial guests: Stonoga, cast of reality show "Królowe Życia", spouting distasteful, sexually-charged jokes.
The lottery's overseeing committee was never shown by the cameras. The lottery failed to achieve its desired goal of popularising PTW - some prize winners, who were called on the phone live as per the lottery's regulations, had no idea who and why called them, and did not recognize the names Pawłowski or PTW. After it was finished, the prize draw show quickly went private on YouTube, and other lottery-related materials started to disappear from the Internet.

#### More high-profile exits

Right after PTW#6, long-time PTW commentator Arkadiusz Paterek confirmed his departure in a [tweet][paterek-tweet].
On May 25 2024, Paterek and Łukasz "Balik" Baliński (who also does commentary for PTW's events) appeared on the relaunched _WrestleOne_ Youtube channel.
This channel is ran by wrestling influencer, and one-time freak fighter, Patryk "Patrykos" Domke.
In a livestream originally focused on an upcoming WWE event in Saudi Arabia, both Paterek and Balik briefly mentioned their PTW tenures.
Around the 13:50 timestamp, Balik confirms his departure from PTW as well.
According to Paterek, this means that all original commentary team members have now left.
Later he also stated that Pawłowski failed to even read his farewell message, and claims that Paterek has "stabbed him in the back".

On May 31st, PTW wrestler [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) appeared on the [first episode][dziedzic-ngz] of "No Gimmick Zone", a new YouTube show by Błażej "Blaze" Pniewski.
Blaze, who was a vocal supporter of PTW up to this point, expressed his disappointment at the [Total Blast](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) show, and slowly but surely turned against the project.
Dziedzic openly appeared under his real name (Kacper Dziedzic), in a shoot-style interview.
He discussed various backstage topics, from the creation of gimmicks, to issues in PTW and the wider Polish scene.
He supported the vision of _Polish Wrestling Without Boundaries_, a phrase which Pawłowski coined but never truly committed to.
This concept is about inter-promotional cooperation on the Polish scene.
Dziedzic alleged that, even if Pawłowski disliked his remarks, he will stay loyal to PTW as that's where his heart is.
He stated that he's going to attend PTW training on the upcoming Sunday, and face possible consequences.

On Sunday June 2nd, a rumor was posted on the PTW Facebook fan group - that Dziedzic, [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) have been released by PTW.
The fans quickly linked these departures with Dziedzic's shoot interview for Blaze.
On the next day, Monday June 3rd, Dziedzic confirmed his departure from PTW in a [heartfelt goodbye post][dziedzic-farewell-insta] on Instagram.
After some teasing on his Instagram Stories, Sinister confirmed the speculations as well. On Wednesday, June 5th 2024, he shared a [farewell post][sinister-farewell-insta] of his own.
Shortly after that, referee Seweryn also confirmed his departure on his Instagram story.

On June 6th [Boro](@/w/boro.md) added a set of stories on Instagram, titled "PTW Last Dance". It contained mostly photos of various moments in PTW he was part of, but also several photos with "the greens" (an insider term for wrestlers from [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) like himself),
some of whom already quit PTW. The final image in this set was just a black background with text saying "Merci et au revoir" (Thank you and goodbye), strongly implying that he left PTW as well.

#### Silence and confusion

As this crisis was developing, PTW's social media channels stayed silent.

PTW Champion [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md)'s Instagram account posted a cryptic message stating "Chapter closed".
This led to fans speculating that he may be the next one to leave PTW, but this turned out not to be the case.
On May 17th 2024, he tweeted a [long statement][puncher-statement], comprising of 3 screenshots where he described his road to championship, all the sacrifices he made, and accepted the blame for PTW 6 and the lottery flop.
However, he also included passive-aggressive remarks about "disloyal" members of the locker room, and excessive fan criticism halting the growth of wrestling in Poland.
Reactions to that statement were mixed, ranging from praise to mockery.
This launched a wave of similar, shorter statements from other roster members, claiming they're going to stay with PTW through thick and thin, and would rather go down together with the organization rather than leave it because of its problems.

PTW's fate was uncertain at that point, with multiple exits and nothing in the way of official announcements.
With one exception: a tribute post commemorating [John "Bad Bones" Klinger](@/w/bad-bones.md), who died from a heart attack on May 20th.

On May 29th, Ryucon, a manga themed fan meeting (which previously hosted PTW events in [2022](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md) and [2023](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md)), [announced][ptw-ryucon-3] that they're hosting a third PTW event.
However, as of June 5th, not a single mention on the show was made on PTW's official social media channels.
The only activity were wrestlers [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and Vincent Caravaggio feuding online, building a potential match for that show.

#### Ludwiczek confronts PTW

On May 23, Ludwiczek (co-host of [Gruby Temat](#new-youtube-show-gruby-temat)) took direct shots at PTW in an [instagram post][ludwiczek-vs-ptw-instagram] promoting his upcoming match in Polish freak-fight organization Clout MMA (which Pawłowski was also affiliated with, and appeared as host on their shows).
He claimed to "be ready for everything", and that "working with PTW and Arek [Pawłowski]" made him indestructible.
In further comments, he bashed PTW, Pawłowski, their ring ("mouldy mat, far from white") and the locker room.
In response to that, PTW personalities, such as [Taras](@/w/taras.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) called out the hypocrisy in his words.
According to them, Ludwiczek received a hefty paycheck, free rides in luxury cars, and enjoyed time with celebrities. Therefore, he had no rights to bash the promotion that only benefitted him, whatever internal problems they may have.
Ludwiczek explained that he was never actually employed by PTW, but rather by an outside investor, and that the lottery was his main focus.
In his words, "protecting the lottery" was the reason why he did not confront Pawłowski and PTW earlier.
Later, several ex-PTW personalities, e.g. [Samson](@/w/samson.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) joined the thread to express their disdain of Pawłowski.

Eventually, both addressed the issue. Pawłowski, in an [interview][pawlowski-tvreklamy] for the TVreklama Youtube channel, expressed his disappointment in Ludwiczek, and called out his laziness and hypocrisy.
Ludwiczek, in a [video of his own][ludwiczek-klamstwa-pawlowskiego], retorted by also calling Pawłowski a lazy hypocrite.
