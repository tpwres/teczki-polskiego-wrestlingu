Polish Wrestling Federation was a backyard federation active around August 2007 in Świebodzin.

## History

Not much is known about Polish Wrestling Federation due to its rather short lifespan. The first archivized internet entry about this backyard comes from August 28th, 2007 post made on WrestleFans forum. It was published by PWF's owner Robert "Traceur" Michalski. Besides him, only one other worker is known: Jonatan "Jaell" Dąbrowski. While the first show wasn't published due to poor quality, they published their second show - PWF RAW - avaliable for download. From the archivized footage it is known, that the group didn't owned any makeshift - let alone professional - wrestling ring, producing their shows in their own home. Couple of days later they also published their second show - Day of The Champion, which is now unavaliable. Soon after forum thread went quiet, as PWF quietly shut down after just one month after online activity despite Traceur's plans to produce more shows.

## Championships 

At Day Of The Champion a championship fight took place. However, due to lack of avaliable footage from the show further deteails are unknown. It can be only guessed that the championship was called PWF Championship.
