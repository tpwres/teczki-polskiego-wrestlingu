Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation was an unsucessful semi-professional wrestling project active from late 1999/early 2000, until 2003. 

## History

At the end of the ‘90s or the beginning of 2000, [Andrzej Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md) - who already promoted wrestling in Poland with [Supron Stars](@/o/supron-stars.md) and [World Wrestling Superstars](@/o/wws.md) in the early 1990s - was contacted by [Paweł “Boryss” Borkowski](@/w/pawel-borkowski.md), who proposed creating the first fully professional Polish pro-wrestling federation, aptly named "Polish Pro-Wrestling Federation". Despite gathering a group of people (none of whom had any prior contact with wrestling), holding trainings and even importing a professional ring (albeit very late), PPWF held no shows. The initial attempt failed due to very low ticket sales, and the second try, in 2003, ended when the sponsor pulled out mere three weeks before the planned show, despite Borkowski and Supron securing the support of a Belgian wrestler and promoter, Bernard Vandamme. PPWF folded, marking the end of the pre-modern era of Polish wrestling - until it was revived in 2009 by the arrival of [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md).
