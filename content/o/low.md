### History

#### 2024: A new chapter

_See also: [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md)._

Over the course of 2023 and 2024 multiple wrestlers left [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), either quitting voluntarily or being removed by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).
Dissatisfied with their former promotion, they decided to start a wrestling project of their own which, unlike PTW, would be open to cooperation with other Polish organisations.
In early August of 2024 a number of former PTW wrestlers and staff posted to their social media teasing upcoming wrestling-related news.

On the 14th of August a [reveal trailer][reveal-trailer] was posted to a new YouTube channel named Legacy of Wrestling.
Set to Studio Buffo's cover of Krystyna Prońko's song "Psalm stojących w kolejce" (_The Psalm of Those Standing in Line_, a protest song from the early days of [Solidarity][solidarnosc]), the trailer showed a couple of PTW-related fake newspaper clippings and the PTW Intergender Championship (hand-made by [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) out of cardboard, and only vaguely recognised by PTW), followed by several ex-PTW wrestlers: Hammers, [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), as well as Jakub Linde (formerly Jakob Sigmarsson) who's currently on the [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) roster.
It then showed the LOW logo and closed with [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) singing "All You Need is Love" by The Beatles.

On the 5th of September LOW [posted on Facebook][qa-post] stating that a live Q&A session would be held on YouTube in a few days, in order to answer people's questions, confirm certain theories and deny others. The document was signed "Pan Prezes" (_Mister Chairman_), harkening back to the early days of [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) when a mysterious "Mister Chairman" was often mentioned, but never actually seen.
