Legacy of Wrestling is a Polish wrestling federation founded in 2024, based mainly in the Katowice area.

## History

### 2024: A new chapter

_See also: [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md)_

Over the course of 2023 and 2024 multiple wrestlers left [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), either quitting voluntarily or being removed by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).
Dissatisfied with their former promotion, they decided to start a wrestling project of their own which, unlike PTW, would be open to cooperation with other Polish organisations.
In early August of 2024 a number of former PTW wrestlers and staff posted to their social media teasing upcoming wrestling-related news.

On the 14th of August a [reveal trailer][reveal-trailer] was posted to a new YouTube channel named Legacy of Wrestling.
Set to Studio Buffo's cover of Krystyna Prońko's song "Psalm stojących w kolejce" (_The Psalm of Those Standing in Line_, a protest song from the early days of [Solidarity][solidarnosc]), the trailer showed a couple of PTW-related fake newspaper clippings and the [PTW Intergender Championship](@/c/ptw-intergender-championship.md) (hand-made by [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) out of cardboard, and only vaguely recognised by PTW), followed by several ex-PTW wrestlers: Hammers, [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), as well as [Jakub Linde](@/w/jakub-linde.md) (formerly Jakob Sigmarsson), who at the time was on [PpW Ewenement's](@/o/ppw.md) roster.
It then showed the Legacy logo and closed with [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) singing "All You Need is Love" by The Beatles.

On the 5th of September LOW [posted to Facebook][qa-post] stating that a live Q&A session would be held on YouTube in a few days, in order to answer people's questions, confirm certain theories and deny others. The document was signed "Pan Prezes" (_Mister Chairman_), harkening back (albeit unintentionally) to the early days of [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) when a mysterious "Mister Chairman" was often mentioned, but never actually seen.

#### The live Q&A

On 9.09.2024 LOW held a [live Q&A][live-qa-1] on YouTube hosted by [Piotr "ShowOff" Małecki](@/w/piotr-malecki.md), who anwsered questions asked by fans on Legacy's social media. The stream lasted around 75 minutes, during which ShowOff shared the following information:

* Unlike other Polish promotions thus far, Legacy is not going to have their own wrestling school, focusing on organising events instead.
* LOW might have their own championship titles; that remains to be seen.
* Legacy may put together a show in 2024; more information should be available soon, including the time, place and perhaps even tickets.
* The enigmatic "Mister Chairman" is someone who's been following Polish wrestling from the back seat and now wants to do something his own way. He is neither ["Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) nor [PTW](@/o/ptw.md)'s co-founder, Rzeźnik.
* Legacy won't have their own roster of home-grown talent. Instead, they're aiming to be an indie federation, offering wrestlers from other promotions a place to work and gain experience and exposure.
* They want to cooperate relatively regularly with a core group of people allowing them to build storylines, while inviting other wrestlers from Poland and perhaps even from abroad (though from nearby rather than from far away).
* Legacy talked to nearly every Polish promotion and hope to have talked to all of them before the [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md).
* The group will most likely be based in Katowice, with shows in other cities being a possibility, though not the main focus.
* LOW is not connected to PTW, aside from the experience gained there and the ambition to improve on some of PTW's perceived shortcomings.
* The first show will be their version of [All In][all-in], meant to test how much can be done within the context of one event, and based on that they'll decide on the best course of action to take.
* LOW currently focuses on making their first event the best it can be. However, it is within the realm of possibility that the fist Legacy show will also be their last, if things don't work out.
* Owing to the above, the first show will be close-ended in case it never gets a follow-up, but will leave enough doors open in case of the opposite.
* The wrestlers will be paid for their appearances (this was a jab at "Pan" Pawłowski who, according to [Samson](@/w/samson.md), failed to properly compensate his workers financially).
* The first show will take place in Silesia, with Katowice being especially hinted at.
* They have their own ring, the origin of which is currently unknown.
* LOW don't expect [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) to want to work for them, nor for "Pan" Pawłowski to agree to it.
* There's going to be beer.
* Legacy aims for pure wrestling, without relying on various influencers to gain media exposure, like PTW did.
* Tickets will cost no more than 100&nbsp;PLN (approximately 23&nbsp;EUR, 19.5&nbsp;GBP, 26&nbsp;USD, 3700&nbsp;JPY or 23,000&nbsp;[KPW][best-korea-best-money] as of September 2024).
* Legacy wants to be open for cooperation with various wrestling YouTube outlets, such as [What is Wrestling][yt-wiw], [WrestleOne][yt-w1], [Attitude][yt-atti], [Istota Wrestlingu][yt-iw], [Blaze][yt-blaze], [Patrykos][yt-pat] and others.
* There's a possibility that other promotions' championship titles could be defended at LOW shows.
* Only a handful of people in Poland have serious experience and knowledge managing a wrestling promotion, none of whom are working for Legacy. They do, however, have people with the know-how of putting together events (wrestling and otherwise), some of whom used to work with PTW.
* LOW hopes the first event is going to feature at least one wrestler from each Polish promotion.
* Wrestlers will most likely retain their current gimmicks, rather than have brand-new ones specifically for Legacy. All the past events that happened to those wrestlers in their respective promotions are going to be canonical for LOW and will exist in their own continuity.
* When asked if the event will be recorded and/or streamed live, ShowOff said they want to keep some things a secret for the time being.
* ShowOff would like [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) to appear at the show.
* The idea for Legacy of Wrestling began to take shape when first people [started leaving PTW](@/a/ptw-exits.md).
* The abbreviation "LOW" will rarely be used, with "Legacy" being the official short name. "Legacy of Wrestling" was chosen in part jokingly, as they wanted people to have rather "LOW" expectations (unlike when PTW took off).

#### The road to the first show

On 25.09.2024 Legacy [posted to Facebook][fb-1st-show-date] revealing the date and location of the fist show: 1.12.2024, in the [Królestwo music club](@/v/krolestwo-katowice.md) in Katowice. In addition, a [short trailer][yt-1st-show-trailer] was posted to their YouTube channel, shot in the same location and starring the same people as the [reveal trailer][reveal-trailer].

The next day there was [another live Q&A][live-qa-2], once again hosted by [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md).

* [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) will appear at the show; Sinister's stable may or may not exist any more.
* In one of the comments [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) said "Once you have those tag team titles, let us know".
* They don't want to be PTW 2.0 and "clinically PG", but also don't want to go to the opposite extreme. The "hardcore level" of PTW, such as [Axel Fox vs Justin Joy](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), is enough.
* The venue should hold about 300 people.
* The [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) might be the only one, but LOW have long-term plans nonetheless.
* Legacy spoke to [MCW](@/o/mcw.md), but not in the context of wrestlers.
* There's going to be a [Patronite][patronite] (a Polish Patreon equivallent) offering a limited run of T-shirts.
* A live stream was confirmed, although the platform has not yet been decided upon. A few options are being considered.
* The first event won't have a subtitle or a number, it'll simply be named "Legacy of Wrestling".
* The full card should be known in the first week of November and the first match in mid-October.
* There's going to be a match between wrestlers from different federations.
* Legacy are happy with their talks with other promotions.
* The first event should be about 2:30-2:45 hours long.

In October 2024 Legacy started unveiling the wrestlers booked for the [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). On 3.10.2024 they [announced][fb-reveal-1] [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), all of whom were in the [reveal trailer][reveal-trailer]. About a week later [another post][fb-reveal-2] announced the first wrestler not seen in the trailer, and the first active worker from another promotion: [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) from [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). Over next weeks, talent from [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) and [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) joined the line-up.

On November 11th, fans [spotted LOW][extreme-low-1] at the Extreme Sports Channel website - a long-time home to wrestling in Poland, which recently entered a partnership with [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) to air their shows. The following day Legacy [officially confirmed][extreme-low-2] the deal, announcing that the channel became their official media partner and their [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) would air on Extreme Sports Channel a week after the event, on the 8th of December.

### 2025

#### The second show

On 27.01.2025 Legacy [published a teaser image][low-2-teaser] for "Legacy of Wrestling Vol. 2". A [trailer][low-2-trailer] for the show was published on 18.02.2025, along with an announcement of [another live Q&A][live-qa-3], which took place on 19.02.2025. Again, the Q&A was hosted by [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md).

* The show is named "Legacy of Wrestling vol. 2" in reference to [Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2][galaktyczni-2].
* Like previously, the show will take place on a Sunday, as this was the only available date that didn't clash with other wrestling shows.
* There were no expectations regarding Patronite before the [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md).
* The VIP tickets (entry + limited T-shirt + signed poster) for Legacy vol. 2 are an attempt at a different approach, rather than a reaction to the Patronite results.
* The chances for someone from [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) appearing at the show are nearly zero, with the current LOW-PTW relations being "complicated".
* Events from [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) and [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) shows are considered canon by Legacy, but what happens at Legacy shows may or may not be considered canon by other promotions.
* There will be fewer seats than the last time in order to fit more people in the venue, and sell more tickets.
* There will be no Patreon this time around.
* The limited T-shirts should be available for sale at the show, but it'll be cheaper to buy the VIP ticket with the T-shirt included.
* People who don't train as much will be used in roles other than in-ring competition, to keep the quality of the show consistently high.
* Legacy are considering their own championship titles, but first they want to establish themselves as a promotion with regular events.
* The second show will air on Extreme Sports Channel, and will be made available on YouTube about two weeks later.
* There are talks with regards to international wrestlers. Legacy are willing to have one or two guests from abroad, but Polish wrestlers are their primary focus.
* Prior to the first show, Legacy talked with KPW first, before moving on to their individual wrestlers.
* Legacy hope to have some KPW wrestlers at the second event as well.
* The ring will most likely be supplied by MZW again.
* The musical chairs from the first show were a reference to a [similar segment][krzesla-balora] in Progress Wrestling, featuring Finn Bálor.
* There were no talks with [Mine City Wrestling](@/o/mcw.md) this time; Legacy don't see a feasible way to have MCW be a part of the show with both sides being satisfied.
* Legacy talked to MCW with the hopes of borrowing their ring for the first show, but those talks fell through.
* There's a chance Express Pizza might be Legacy's sponsor again.
* Kubes, [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Balik](@/w/lukasz-balinski.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) and Mister Chairman were confirmed to be at the second show (though Mr. Chairman may or may not appear publicly).
* [Arek Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) should be at the show too; [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) perhaps as well.
* Everyone who appeared at the first show is invited to the second one.
* There will be matches between wrestlers from different promotions.
* [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) won't be the host again. There's a possibility that each show will feature a different host.
* There might be another live Q&A before the show.
* (There wasn't.)

#### Excursion to Kraków

The [third show](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) was officially announced in the early May. Instead of taking place in Katowice on a Sunday, this time the event was held on a Friday, the first day of the anime/manga convention Ryucon. Notably, Ryucon had previously seen shows by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) on [three](@/e/ptw/2022-07-31-ptw-x-ryucon.md) [consecutive](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md) [years](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md). However, following [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), PTW has seemingly fallen out of favour with the organisers of the convention, and Legacy was chosen in its stead. As it was with the PTW shows, Legacy attracted random con attendees in addition to the usual wrestling fans.

Legacy of Wrestling vol. 3 was a proper LOW event counting towards the promotion's timeline, unlike eg. [PpW's](@/o/ppw.md) non-canonical shows such as [Lucha Libre Extravaganza](@/e/ppw/2025-05-16-ppw-lucha-libre-extravaganza.md). The show featured the continuation of the Road to the Title series of matches started at [Legacy vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), and the Legacy Championship was announced to be the main prize at the fourth show.

#### The fourth show and Championship title

The fourth show was announced on 30.09.2025 in a [Facebook post][low-4-fb], which also revealed the name of the event - [Legacy of Wrestling: Four the Glory](@/e/low/2025-12-20-low-4.md).

On 2.10.2025 [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md) and [Wiktor D.](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) held a [live Q&A][live-qa-4] in which they answered some of the fan questions and gave some details of the upcoming show.

* Legacy 4 will take place on Saturday, 20.12.2025, once again in the [Królestwo music club](@/v/krolestwo-katowice.md).
* The show will take around 2.5 hours, plus a break.
* For the time being Legacy will hold their shows in Katowice due to financial reasons (although they'd like to visit other places as well).
* The goal for 2026 is to have four events per year.
* Currently there are no plans for additional championship titles beyond the main one.
* The LOW Championship could be defended in other promotions.
* There'll be [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md).
* There could be somebody who hasn't appeared at a Legacy show before.
* There's a chance for [Boro](@/w/boro.md) to have a match.
* The Championship fight will have all six contenders in the ring, but no stipulation was given.
* There are chances for non-standard stipulations.
* Special limited T-shirts with "Legacy of Wrestling √16" logo are available through the ticketing website KupBilecik.pl only.
* They would want to return to Ryucon in 2026.
* There'll be another live Q&A.

## Polish wrestling scene

Legacy of Wrestling became the first professional wrestling promotion openly admitting to not intending on having their own talent. The federation's whole plan revolves around making a supercard-style shows with wrestlers from [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) and [MZW](@/o/mzw.md), with some addition of workers who left [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) and don't make appearances anywhere else. The plan succeded, with LOW being the first place on the Polish wrestling scene history where KPW wrestlers worked against wrestlers from another Polish promotions, whereas the first cooperation between MZW and PpW took place [in 2023](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md).

## Championships

Legacy hinted that they will promote their own championship during multiple live Q&A videos, with a build-up for the final title match starting at [Legacy vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md). As of October 2025 it is known that the first Legacy champion will be crowned at [Legacy's fourth show](@/e/low/2025-12-20-low-4.md).
