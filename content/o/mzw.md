MZW was estabilished in 2014, which currently makes it the oldest active professional promotion in Poland. MZW has no regular or titular sponsors, and considers itself an independent European promotion. Wrestlers who trained with them are highly regarded for their skills, and some have continued their career outside of Poland.

## History

### 2013: DDW's hiatus

Maniac Zone Wrestling started quietly in 2013, created by then-DDW wrestlers [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) and [Straceniec](https://tpwres.pl/w/shadow.md).
After [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md), there was a significant hiatus when they held no events.
On April 1st, 2014, Jędruś Bułecka's posted on his Facebook profile that he had signed up with a new Polish wrestling federation.
His post linked to a newly created fanpage for MZW, and a short video of their wrestlers and rookies in action.
The new organization promised regular monthly shows, bigger events including foreign stars, and training sessions.

Initially, the roster featured Jędruś Bułecka, Shadow (a new, masked gimmick of the former Straceniec), and several ex-backyard wrestlers trained by Bułecka.
Many of these characters were masked, leading to fans calling the new organisation "Polish lucha".
Because their first two events were sideshows on other attractions like various town festivals, fans derided the new organisation for being just a sideshow and not aiming for professionalism. However, there was consensus that their wrestling was of very high quality, exceeding that of their contemporaries.

### 2018: Moving to Wrocław

Since 2018, MZW held most of their events in Wrocław, either in [Bakara](@/v/bakara.md) or [Czasoprzestrzeń](@/v/czasoprzestrzen.md), with the latter becoming their main venue.
Before that, it was the [sports hall in Głuchołazy](@/v/gosir-glucholazy.md), a town near the Polish-Czech border where many of their events took place, and where they trained new rookies. Prior to that, events were held in various small towns in the region, like Opawa, Smolec and Niedźwiedzica.

In September 2019 persons unknown broke into the building where MZW held trainings and stole elements of the ring as well as lighting, thus forcing the promotion to put their trainings and shows on hold. MZW then held a [crowdfunding campaign][mzw-zbiorka] to raise money to replace the stolen equipment, and managed to collect 3566 PLN out of the 3000 PLN goal.

### 2020: Post-COVID and losing talent to PTW

MZW was most active from 2014 to 2019, holding about five events a year. 2020 put a stop to that due to the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide restrictions introduced. In 2021, unable to hold shows, MZW produced a series of events without live audience ([Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md)), which were released on YouTube. No events of any kind were held in 2022.

In 2020 and 2021 several wrestlers would quit and join the newly created [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) to become part of its first roster. These were [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Prince Victor](@/w/vic-golden.md), [Nathan Cross](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Lady Killer](@/w/boro.md) and [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md).

In 2024, MZW held a fight for the long-vacant [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md), and a [new champion](@/w/matt-buckna.md) was finally crowned.

## Foreign relations

MZW frequently cooperated with German organizations, especially with Dresden-based Next Step Wrestling and Eastside Revolution Wrestling. In their early days, the Germans would often outnumber Polish wrestlers present.

## Polish wrestling scene

Prior to 2021, MZW did not interact with other organizations in Poland.
This changed with [PpW Poznań Supershow](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md), where talent from [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) faced against MZW regulars [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) and [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md). It was later revealed that this appearance wasn't fully allowed by MZW, and was one of the reasons for the "Green Revolution" in October 2021, which caused a mass exodus of MZW's talent group called [Zieloni](@/tt/zieloni.md).

In 2022, after quitting PTW, former MZW wrestler [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) appeared at [PpW Brak Mi Słów](@/e/ppw/2022-09-10-ppw-brak-mi-slow.md).
In September 2023 the two organizations ran a [co-branded event](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md), and 2024 saw MZW's founder [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) compete at [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md).

This collaboration was unique, as the other two active organizations (KPW and PTW) preferred to be standalone, and saw no value in letting others use their talent. This was true of MZW as well, but the COVID-induced hiatus, followed by the talent drain, may have forced them to reconcider. The cooperation between PpW and MZW opened the Polish forbidden door for good after over a decade of [DDW's](@/o/ddw.md) "exclusivity clause" mentality, and as of 2025, MZW is fully open for booking talent from PpW and [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md).

According to [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), plenty of people from PpW and from Toruń trained with MZW. The one condition MZW had was that wrestlers who wanted to work for them could not perform in backyard, but they weren't stopped from appearing in other pro federations. 

## Mainstream media

On 14.01.2016 a local branch of the national broadcaster, TVP3 Opole, invited [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) to appear on their morning programme ["O!polskie o poranku"][mzw-tvp3-opole]. The interviewers asked about the basics of pro wrestling, the history of MZW and how the two guests became interested in wrestling in the first place. The interview was intercut with clips from the [2015 charity show](@/e/mzw/2015-01-11-mzw-charity-show-2015.md). At the beginning of the segment, archival footage from [PXW](@/o/pxw.md) was also shown to illustrate the progress made by the group.

In 2020, TVP3 Wrocław published a [short piece on MZW][mzw-tvp3], titled "Staged and seemingly dangerous. Wrestling gains popularity in Wrocław". The narrator talks about the staged nature of wrestling as entertainment, while several rookies and wrestlers practice bumps in the ring wearing face masks (as this was produced during the COVID-19 pandemic). [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), introduced as [PAW](@/o/paw.md)'s coach, talks about training and safety. MZW's flag is clearly visible in the background.

## Championships

MZW has one singles championship, with Shadow having the longest combined reigns as of 2024. Between 2016 and 2019 they also used to have a Tag Team championship, currently inactive.
