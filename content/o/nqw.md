New Quality Wrestling was an early backyard group from Warsaw, active between 2007 and 2009. 

## History

Little is known about NQW as there doesn't appear to be any information available online, and the only insight can be gleaned from the former members and materials from the first show surviving in their private archives.

According to one of the members of NQW - [Istociarz](@/w/istociarz.md) - the group consisted of him (under the ring name "LJ Blade"), another fan working as "Suicide" (who years later worked behind the bar at [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md)), and a group of friends forced to partake in various roles, from wrestlers to the crowd and crew. At the second show they were joined by another "forced" friend, who wrestled as "Punk" and sustained an eye injury after a bout with LJ Blade.
