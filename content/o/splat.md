Splat!FilmFest is an annual genre film festival, which focuses on horrors, thrillers, black comedies, sci-fi and fantasy films. Having started in 2015 in Lublin, the festival later expanded to Warsaw and Wrocław, before making Warsaw its main location since 2018.

In 2024 and 2025 Splat!FilmFest included wrestling in its programme. 2024 saw a non-canon [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) show accompany the screenings, held directly in the lounge area between screening rooms. In 2025, [Lunatic][imdb-lunatic], a documentary about wrestler Luna Vachon will be screened, accompanied by another, Halloween-themed PpW wrestling showcase in the same location.
