Splat!FilmFest is an annual genre film festival, which focuses on horrors, thrillers, black comedies, sci-fi and fantasy films. Having started in 2015 in Lublin, the festival later expanded to Warsaw and Wroc≈Çaw, before making Warsaw its main location since 2018.

In 2024 and 2025 Splat!FilmFest included wrestling in its programme. 2024 saw a non-canon [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) show accompany the screenings, held directly in the lounge area between screening rooms. In 2025, [Lunatic][imdb-lunatic], a documentary about wrestler Luna Vachon will be screened, accompanied by another, Halloween-themed PpW wrestling showcase in the same location.
