Line of Pro was a backyard federation active some time between 2010 and 2014. It was located in Rybnik.

## History

According to the person responsible for promoting the backyard - forum user "MF" - Line of Pro first started in the early 2010. All of its structure was directly based on WWE programming. It had its own history and feuds, and according to "MF", over 20 backyard performers passed through the federation since its creation.

As of 2025 virtually no information about LOP pre-2014 can be found. It is most likely caused by the fact that LOP distributed their shows only among their peers, and the footage was not openly published. The only show avaliable publicly is [LOP's Wrestlemania III](@/e/lop/2014-04-27-lop-wrestlemania-iii.md). Uniquely for backyard, the show was streamed live - possibly as one of the first live streams on the Polish wrestling scene.

After April 2014, Line of Pro went quiet for some time. Their return was announced in May 2015, for when LOP's roster would finish their final school exams, but it seemingly never happened.

## Championships 

Line of Pro didn't promote their own unique championships. Instead, they were used titles promoted by [WWE](@/o/wwe.md), such as:

- WWELOP Championship
- World Heavyweight Championship
- Intercontinental Championship

Line of Pro also promoted their own Money in the Bank briefcase.
