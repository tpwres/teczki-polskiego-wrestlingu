Line of Pro was a backyard federation active sometime between 2010 and 2014. It was located in Rybnik.

## History

According to person responsible for promoting the backyard - user "MF" - Line of Pro first started in early 2010. All of its structure was directly based on WWE programming. It had its own history and feuds, and according to "MF" over 20 backyard performers passed through the federation since its creation.

As of 2025 virtually no information about LOP pre-2014 can be found. It is most probably caused by the fact, that LOP distributed their shows only among their peers, and the footage was not published to the public. The only show avaliable for public was [LOP's Wrestlemania III](@/e/lop/2014-04-27-lop-wrestlemania-iii.md). It was a quite unique show due to fact, that it was streamed live - possibly as one of the first live streams of a show at Polish wrestling scene.

After April 2014 Line of Pro went quiet for some time. The return was announced on May 2015 as soon as LOP's roster will finish their school leaving exams, but it seemingly never happened.

## Championships 

Line of Pro had not promoted their own unique championships. They were using titles promoted by [WWE](@/o/wwe.md), such as:

- WWELOP Championship
- World Heavyweight Championship
- Intercontinental Championship

Line of Pro also promoted their own Money In The Bank briefcase.
