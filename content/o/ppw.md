PpW is a wrestling promotion from Warsaw. It styles itself as a fully independent, self-sufficient organization with no commercial affiliations.
Their wrestling style used to rely heavily on hardcore and deathmatches, but it has since been toned down, and other styles of wrestling are prominently featured. However, no-DQ is assumed for most matches, and its main events are still often hardcore bouts. Only the rare Classic Wrestling Match stipulation prohibits any weapons and interventions.

### Name

There was no canonical meaning of the PpW acronym, however recently, it was repurposed to match "Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu" (_Beer is Wrestling's Friend_).
The official name is just "PpW Ewenement". The word _ewenement_ means something unique, special and not easily replicated, and could be translated as "phenomenon" or "anomaly".

### History

#### 2010: backyard years

PPW dates its origins back to 2010, when a group of teenage friends started emulating their favourite wrestlers. The original arena for their matches was a public playground, and later a common yard which gave the organization its first name: Polski Podwórkowy Wrestling (_Polish Yard Wrestling_ - note that backyards, in the Anglo-Saxon world defined as private enclosed outdoor areas behind terraced houses, are not common in Poland).
Until about 2014, the primary location was located next to the intersection of Kuratowski and Arbuzowa streets in Warsaw. The name for this venue was [Placyk PPW](http://ppw-fandom.tpwres.pl/placyk-ppw), and it had no proper ring.

According to [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), simultaneously there was also Polski Szkolny Wrestling (_Polish School Wrestling_), where shoot-style fights between classmates were held in [their school](http://ppw-fandom.tpwres.pl/gubin), complete with a ranking of sorts. That class had significant overlap with the roster of the other PPW. Later this organization of sorts was renamed to PPW (second P standing for Poszkolny or _After-School_), and later yet renamed to PPPW to distinguish the two. Ultimately, the two merged to create the current incarnation of PpW.

The group made some attempts to build a proper ring, despite having no money or experience. The first structure to be recognized as one was created out of discarded mattresses, rugs, tires, floor mats and other junk. Later, another one was built from wooden pallets, and some metal pillars in the corners.

An actual ring, though undersized, was created in 2017, designed by [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md). The group pooled their money together, and ordered the metal structure at a local welding shop. According to [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), the craftsman was intrigued and amused at the project, and gave the group a significant discount because of that. It was still used as the primary ring until 2023, and relegated to their wrestling school afterwards.

Uniquely for the Polish wrestling scene, PpW shares no ancestry with other promotions, many of which can be traced back to [DDW](@/o/ddw.md).

#### 2019: going pro

Probably the first event that PpW held for an open audience (as opposed to just friends and insiders to the backyard scene) was 2019's [2Koła to my nie zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md), followed by [Brawl For The Puppies](@/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md).
The latter event began PpW's pro era. It was the first one to invite foreign guests, and PpW's wrestlers receiving professional training. First from [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), later also by the invited guests who would hold training sessions.
After establishing themselves as a serious organization, and building a network of contacts, PpW talent started appearing abroad: in Sweden, Austria, and later Hungary.

2021 saw them invite several [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) wrestlers for a show held during a [craft beer festival](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md) in Poznań, with a [reprise](@/e/ppw/2023-11-24-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu.md) two years later.
In 2023, PpW was recognized by Cagematch, and some of its events and wrestlers have been added to their database. WrestleMap features news about PpW since 2021.

#### 2023: Prime Time Transfers, professional ring

In 2023, due to tensions in [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), a number of its wrestlers appeared on PpW shows, quitting their promotion openly and criticizing its owner on social media. This further boosted PpW's image on the Polish scene, as a place dedicated to the joy of wrestling, and not commercial endeavors. Later, PpW named this event, and the wrestlers "Prime Time Transfers". The first one to appear was [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md), followed by [Samson](@/w/samson.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and later his tag team partner [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md).

Over the weekend of March 6-8 2024, PpW wrestlers [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) posted stories on Instagram, which featured them in a ring that was slightly larger than PpW's regular one. Three days later, on March 11th, Mister Z, kayfabe executive producer and booker, in real-life also co-owner of PpW posted a photo of him and Andrzej Supron on Instagram. They were shaking hands, captioned "Two [guys] happy that the deal went through. Thank you Mr Supron".
The involvement of Supron suggest that this may be the very same ring he [bought in 2010](@/o/tbw.md#2010-successful-events) for Total Blast Wrestling. Hashtags used in the post seem to confirm this.

### Lost Lore

PpW used to have a Wikia page with detailed internal lore and history, including storied feuds, rankings, character backgrounds, past events and videos from the backyard era. This went defunct in 2023. The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine only had an [incomplete version](https://web.archive.org/web/20230422172700/https://ppwofficial.fandom.com/pl/wiki/PPW) available. Snippets could be found in cached results on Google when searching for certain related terms, but most of it was lost.

That wiki was located at `ppwofficial.fandom.com` (and `ppwofficial.wikia.com` earlier before the renaming).

#### Restored!

In March 2024 it has been restored from a backup, in a text-only form, and can be found at [ppw-fandom.tpwres.pl](https://ppw-fandom.tpwres.pl/). It's preserved as-is, with no editing capability, using a basic Wikipedia-like template. While a part of Teczki, since both share a domain, it's treated as an archived publication, made available on the Internet once again.

## Botchamania

#### Biesiad vs Osamu

During a match on [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md) on May 21, 2022, [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) set [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) on a table in the middle of the ring, and climbed on support beams outside the ring to perform a jump onto the opponent. He connected very lightly, landing on his legs instead, and the table failed to break, although one set of legs did collapse. This was featured in [Botchamania 455](https://youtu.be/eurthT-CbUg?t=485), at the 8:05 mark.

#### Goblin vs MBM

The second botch to make it was the table spot from [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), from the El Paso Outlaw Match between [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and Belgian wrestler MBM.
With Goblin lying on a table, MBM climbed the second turnbuckle, put on a pink cowboy hat, straddled a toy hobby horse, and jumped onto the table, which failed to break.
After the fight, both agreed to redo the spot, to the audience's great applause.
This failed spot, and the second attempt were featured in [Botchamania 489](https://youtu.be/lGThcHUL5g0?t=516), at the 8:36 mark.

#### Critical 420 Ladder Match

PpW's third Botchamania entry was from [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md). In the four-man ladder match, just after the opening sequence, Benny Bachhus accidentally grabs the trophy as he falls to the ground when his ladder was knocked. The faces then signal the referee to hang it up again and the match is restarted.
This was featured in [Botchamania 493](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2azqxchwafo), at the 12:10 mark. In another botch on Botchamania's side however, this clip was labeled as "[Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md)", with Maffew probably confusing it with PTW's [event](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) which used that name.
