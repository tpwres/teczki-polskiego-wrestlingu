Supron Stars was the first, semi-professional, wrestling federation in Poland, active in the early 1990s. 

## History

After learning about professional wrestling from TV during his visit to the United States, [Andrzej Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md) - a Polish Greco-Roman olympic wrestler - decided to contact Ivan Putski (a professional wrestler born in Poland) to learn more about the business. Supron decided to bring pro wrestling to Poland, where it was an unknown form of entertaiment at the time. He recruited some bodybuilders, sportsmen and actors (such as [Władysław Komar][komar] and [Edyta Górniak][gorniak]) to train them loosely on his own, before starting a touring federation. They hosted a couple of shows in Poland, but also in ex-Soviet republics, such as Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia, Azerbajian etc. According to the few avaliable sources, these shows were met with good amount of success, especially abroad. The group was active sometime from around 1990 until 1992 when it disbanded, and Andrzej Supron went on to invite foreign, more professional talent to host the [World Wrestling Superstars](@/o/wws.md) show in Poland. Despite very little info avaliable, Supron Stars is considered to be first Polish wrestling organisation in history.
