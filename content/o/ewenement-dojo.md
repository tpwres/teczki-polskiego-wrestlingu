## History

The foundation of Ewenement Dojo was announced on June 8th 2024, at [PpW Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), and later followed by creating Facebook & Instagram profiles of the Dojo.
Ewenement Dojo is an evolution of PpW Dojo, which previously operated semi-officially, and was partially closed for rookies.
In reality it was an auxiliary dojo with no consistent schedule, where PpW talent trained under [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md).

Preceding it was the Summer Wrestling Camp organised by PpW with Jacob Crane as Head Coach, fresh after his return from a three-month stint with Big Japan Wrestling.

For the first time in the Polish wrestling history, it was announced that the training sessions will be held mainly on a weekly basis instead of weekend-only two day training regimes.
This change was inspired by German dojos such as wXw Academy, as well as martial arts dojos.

The first fully Ewenement-grown talent who got a chance to debut at the Polish scene was [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md), who debuted as Adept Oskar (_rookie_ Oskar) before "earning" his ringname. Following him were [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md) and _rookie_ Antek.

Two of the first Ewenement Dojo graduates also made their non-PpW debuts, in a quick succession. [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) made his [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) debut in a losing effort against [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) at [MZW Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md), while [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md) debuted in [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) as a part of a losing team in a six-man tag team main event of [Legacy of Wrestling vol.3](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md).
