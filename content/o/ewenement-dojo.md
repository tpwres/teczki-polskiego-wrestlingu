## History

The foundation of Ewenement Dojo was announced on June 8th 2024, at [PpW Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), and later followed by creating Facebook & Instagram profiles of the Dojo.
Ewenement Dojo is an evolution of PpW Dojo, which previously operated semi-officially, and was partially closed for rookies.
In reality it was an auxiliary dojo with no consistent schedule, where PpW talent trained under [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md).

Preceding it was the Summer Wrestling Camp organised by PpW with Jacob Crane as Head Coach, fresh after his return from a three-month stint with Big Japan Wrestling.

For the first time in the Polish wrestling history, it was announced that the training sessions will be held mainly on a weekly basis instead of weekend-only two day training regimes.
This change was inspired by German dojos such as wXw Academy, as well as martial arts dojos.
