### History

#### 2015: The end of DDW

Kombat Pro Wrestling launched in 2015, after the founder of [DDW](@/o/ddw.md), [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md), closed down his organization.
At the end of 2014, DDW's operations moved from Rzeszów, where Roid lived with his family, to Gdańsk.
The two cities are more than 600 km apart, and the team in Gdańsk began to run things without Roid's input. Finally, he sold the ring, closed DDW and retired from wrestling entirely.

That team, consisting of several DDW alumni, bought the ring and - after some deliberations regarding the name, with "White Eagle Wrestling" also being considered - relaunched themselves as Kombat Pro Wrestling. Their first event, [KPW vs the World](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md), was held in the exact same venue as [DDW's final event proper](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md) (not counting their [appearance on a convention](@/e/ddw/2015-07-24-ddw-baltikon.md) two months later). Thus KPW is the direct descendant of Do or Die Wrestling.

In 2016 they would relocate to Gdynia, holding their shows in a recently reopened [music club](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md). That year, KPW held the first [Godzina Zero](@/e/kpw/2016-08-13-kpw-godzina-zero-2016.md), which would later become their annual supershow, where all championships were defended. 2017 saw them move to a bigger venue in the [Gdynia Sports Center](@/v/gdynia-sports-center.md), securing support from the city.

#### 2020: COVID and losing talent to PTW

In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and Poland implemented severe restrictions. This caused KPW to go on an 18-month hiatus between [February 2020](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md) and [August 2021](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md), during which their future was uncertain. 2022 saw them resume regular shows, moving back to the previous venue.

[Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) launched in 2021, headed by the controversial Arkadiusz Pawłowski.
Pawłowski was also part of the team of DDW veterans that founded KPW, and later served as their host and ring announcer until [2019](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14-nastepny-poziom.md).
During and after the hiatus, KPW lost several of their headliners who chose to join the new organization: [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md), [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md), as well as the newcomer [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md).

#### 2023 TV deal and FightBox

During the opening moments of [Arena 23](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md), Chairman Malinowski announced that from this moment on KPW's events would be broadcast on cable TV, on an MMA and wrestling-focused channel FightBox. This was finally realized in April 2024, when FightBox aired Arena 23. On April 2, 2024 [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), KPW owner, booker and head trainer, posted [a photo of himself](https://www.facebook.com/kawalerwrestling/posts/pfbid028kdGNo5vEVnSscGnsCzUr9spHsX14gPKk3ocJ7ogMSnnqPh2cxWsuCfMAUyrGdbyl) watching the event on TV, captioning it "Finally the day has come". According to his replies under that post, FightBox wanted to record English commentary in order to broadcast KPW's shows abroad.

### Foreign relations

KPW frequently invited talent from the European independent scene to their events, especially the yearly supershow Godzina Zero. Initially they invited wrestlers from Hungary, with which DDW had good relations. Later, most of the talent came from Germany and Austria. Several wrestlers from the British scene also appeared on KPW's shows. The hottest guest appearance among them were Primate and Wild Boar, by that time a tag team seen in NXT UK, and Mark Haskins, a veteran of the British scene. KPW's own wrestlers occassionally appeared abroad, mostly in Austria and Germany. KPW does not try to draw attendance by relying on foreign stars and, with [a](@/e/kpw/2018-07-14-kpw-oldtown-3.md) [few](@/e/kpw/2018-08-11-kpw-godzina-zero-2018.md) [rare](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md) [exceptions](@/e/kpw/2022-06-18-kpw-pyrkon-2022.md), almost always puts them against their own talent.

### Polish wrestling scene

KPW does not participate in the Polish wrestling scene; they do not share people with other organizations, nor do they invite other Polish performers to their shows. It is speculated to be inherited from Don Roid's way running of DDW, although there was no Polish scene back then. Some Polish-speaking characters did appear on their shows, but all of them were wrestlers of some Polish ancestry, performing abroad.

The Polish IWC reported one incident when fans wearing T-shirts of another Polish organization (specifically PTW) were asked by security to either remove them or wear them inside-out, so as not to show PTW's logo on their own video streaming. They had no issue with other merchandise.

### Championships

As of 2024, KPW has one tag team championship and two singles championships. The main title, KPW Championship, was created in 2016 and won at the first Godzina Zero event. KPW OldTown Championship was created and won at [OldTown Festival 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-07-23-kpw-oldtown-2.md), which was a post-apocalyptic themed LARP event to which KPW was invited to perform. This belt had an unique look befitting its origin, until [2023](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md) when it was replaced with a more conventional style belt.

The Tag Team Championship was created in 2018 and the first champions crowned in 2018, at [Arena 11](@/e/kpw/2018-11-03-kpw-arena-11-podwojne-zagrozenie.md).
