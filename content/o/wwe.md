WWE is an American wrestling federation, and the biggest and most recognizable name in the industry.

## History

Between 2011 and 2015, as part of their European tours, WWE made four stops in Poland,
first as part of their RAW or Smackdown house shows, later under their WWE Live brand.

Nearly 11 years later, in January 2026, WWE is set to return to Poland with a [Road to Royal Rumble](@/e/wwe/2026-01-17-wwe-road-to-royal-rumble.md) show, that'll be a part of an 11-city European tour.

The following roster only lists the talent who appeared on these shows.
