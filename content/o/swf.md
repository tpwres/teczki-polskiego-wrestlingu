Slavic Wrestling Federation was a short-live backyard project aiming to become a federation. It was active around May to June 2014 in Warsaw.

## History

Not much is known about Polish Wrestling Federation due to its rather short lifespan. The first known Internet entry about this backyard comes from an June 6th, 2014 post made on Attitude forum by user "celticconon". He posted a links to both Facebook fanpage (now inactive), and SWF's blogspot website. According to federation introduction at their website they aimed to make product more serious and ambitious than another Polish federations, and even better than [WWE's](@/o/wwe.md) product itself. Federation wanted to promote new style of "eastern, slavic wrestling". They opened up a recrutation for roster, staff workers, interviewers and hostesses. 

The reception of SWF announcement was rather cold, as Attitude forum members pointed out on facts such as lack of basic information about federation, recruitment and many others. User celticconon never responded to many questions asked by the public, as the project eventually folded after just over a month.
