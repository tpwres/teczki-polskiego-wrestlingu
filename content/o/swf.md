Slavic Wrestling Federation was a short-lived backyard project aiming to become a federation. It was active around May to June 2014 in Warsaw.

## History

Little is known about Polish Wrestling Federation due to its rather short lifespan.
The oldest available mention about this backyard comes from a June 6th, 2014 post made on the Attitude forum by user "celticconon".
He posted links to a Facebook fanpage (now inactive) and SWF's Blogspot website. According to the group's introduction at their website, they aimed to make their product more serious and ambitious than other Polish federations, and even better than [WWE](@/o/wwe.md) itself.
SWF wanted to promote a new style of "Eastern, Slavic wrestling". They were looking to enroll people into their roster as wrestlers, staff workers, interviewers and hostesses.

The reception of SWF's announcement was rather cold. Attitude forum members pointed out the lack of basic information about the group or recruitment, and many other flaws. User celticconon never responded to many questions asked by the public, as the project eventually folded after just over a month.
