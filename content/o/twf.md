Toruń Wrestling Federation was a backyard wrestling organisation from Toruń, active between 2011 and 2014.

## History

TWF's beginnings can be traced back to May 2011, when the first concept for a new backyard federation was published on Polish wrestling forums.
It was started by [Hero](@/w/pj-blake.md) and his real-life brother [Monster](@/w/chris-hunter.md) - who later became better known as PJ Blake and Chris Hunter respectively.
In August 2011 the federation announced that they held their first face-to-face meeting. The initial roster allegedly consisted of eight workers. TFW held their first show, which was published online, on September 22nd the same year.

From that point on, TWF managed to publish a number of shows. Their upload schedule was rather irregular, but they remained active over three years.
Their activity intensified especially during holidays, and summer/winter breaks, when the roster had the most free time.
After a very consistent 2012 and the first half of 2013 - when they even managed to perform for live audiences in [middle schools](@/e/twf/2013-03-21-twf-dzien-wiosny.md) and [community centres](@/e/twf/2012-06-10-twf-showcase.md) -
TWF started to slow down, probably caused by a shortage of workers, common among backyard promotions consisting of teenagers.

TWF managed to hold and upload a couple of shows in 2014, however after about three years of activity, it closed in April 2014 soon after [Danger Zone 2014 Episode 2](@/e/twf/2014-04-13-twf-danger-zone-2014-2.md).

A huge part of the roster went on to start [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md).
Among them were [Corin Mear](@/w/corin-mear.md), [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md), [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) and [Jay Revolt](@/w/jay-revolt.md).

## Polish wrestling scene

Some TWF wrestlers worked with other Polish backyards.
The highlight of these appearances was a spot at [Backyardmania III](@/e/pxw/2012-07-24-pxw-backyardmania-3.md), which was organized by Głuchołazy-based [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md).
They also cooperated with Elbląg-area based federation BWN, where some of TWF's workers made their appearances.

## Championships

Toruń Wrestling Federation promoted four Championships in their history:

- TWF Championship - main championship; held by wrestlers such as [Billi Rox](@/w/corin-mear.md) and [Monster](@/w/chris-hunter.md).
- Toruń Championship - secondary title; held by [Hero](@/w/pj-blake.md) most of the time.
- Wrzosy Championship - active some time around March to June 2012, with [Small Jumper](@/w/small-jumper.md) being the sole recognized Champion. Named after Toruń's northernmost district.
- TWF Tag Team Championship - active in June 2012. Won by "Młodzi Gniewni" ([Thunder](@/w/thunder.md) and [Twister](@/w/twister.md)) and never officialy defended.
