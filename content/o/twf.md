Toruń Wrestling Federation was a backyard wrestling organisation from Toruń, active between 2011 and 2014.

## History

TWF's beginnings can be traced back to May 2011, when the first concept for a new backyard federation was published on Polish wrestling forums. It was owned by [Hero](@/w/pj-blake.md) and his real-life brother [Monster](@/w/chris-hunter.md) - who later became more known as PJ Blake and Chris Hunter. In August 2011 the federation announced that they'd held their first face-to-face meeting. The initial roster allegedly consisted of eight workers. They held their first show, which was published online, on September 22nd the same year. 

From that point on TWF published a series of shows. Their upload schedule was rather irregular, but they managed to remain active over the years. Their activity intensified especially during holidays, and summer/winter breaks, when the roster had the most free time. After a very consistent 2012 and the first half of 2013 - when they even managed to perform for live audiences in [middle shools](@/e/twf/2013-03-21-twf-dzien-wiosny.md) and [community centres](@/e/twf/2012-06-10-twf-showcase.md) - TWF started to slow down, which was probably caused by a shortage of workers, common among backyard promotions consisting of teenagers. TFW managed to publish a couple of shows in 2014, before it was eventually closed in April 2014 immediately after [Danger Zone 2014 Episode 2](@/e/twf/2014-04-13-twf-danger-zone-2014-2.md). 

TWF was a place where many of [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) founders started their careers. Among them were [Corin Mear](@/w/corin-mear.md), [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md), [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) and [Jay Revolt](@/w/jay-revolt.md).

Eventually, after about three years of activity, TWF folded its operations in 2014. A huge part of the roster went on to start Dream Factory Wrestling.

## Polish wrestling scene

Some of TWF wrestlers worked with other Polish backyards. The highlight of these appearances was a spot at [Backyardmania III](@/e/pxw/2012-07-24-pxw-backyardmania-3.md), which was held by Głuchołazy-based promotion [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md). They also cooperated with Elbląg-area based federation BWN, where some of TWF's workers made their appearances. 

## Championships

Toruń Wrestling Federation promoted four Championships in their history:

- TWF Championship - main championship; held by wrestlers such as [Billi Rox](@/w/corin-mear.md) and [Monster](@/w/chris-hunter.md).
- Toruń Championship - secondary title; held by [Hero](@/w/pj-blake.md) most of the time.
- Wrzosy Championship - active some time around March to June 2012, with [Small Jumper](@/w/small-jumper.md) being the sole recognized Champion.
- TWF Tag Team Championship - active in June 2012. Won by "Młodzi Gniewni" ([Thunder](@/w/thunder.md) and [Twister](@/w/twister.md)) and never officialy defended.
