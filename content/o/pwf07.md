Polish Wrestling Federation was a short-lived backyard group active around August 2007 in Świebodzin.

## History

Not much is known about Polish Wrestling Federation due to its rather short lifespan.
The first known Internet entry about this backyard comes from an August 28th, 2007 message posted on WrestleFans forum.
It was published by PWF's owner Robert "Traceur" Michalski. Besides him, only one other worker is known: Jonatan "Jaell" Dąbrowski.
While the first show wasn't published due to its poor quality, the group did make their second show - [PWF RAW](@/e/pwf07/2007-08-28-pwf07-raw.md) - available for download. Based on the footage, the group didn't own any makeshift, let alone professional, wrestling ring, producing their shows at home.
A couple of days later they also published their second show, [Day of the Champion](@/e/pwf07/2007-08-30-pwf07-day-of-the-champion.md), which is no longer available. A short time later online activity on the forum stopped, as PWF quietly shut down just one month since their initial post, despite Traceur's plans to produce more shows.

## Championships

A championship fight took place at Day of the Champion. However, due to lack of available footage from the show, further deteails are unknown. It can be only surmised that the championship was called PWF Championship.
