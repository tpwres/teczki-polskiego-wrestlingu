Teraz Albo Nigdy (_Now Or Never_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), set to return to [Mi≈Ñska&nbsp;65](@/v/minska-65.md). This time, the show is set in a different part of the venue complex, _Hala Labo_.

PpW launched the ticket sales exactly two months before the event date. It is the first PpW event to introduce three tiers of tickets, with varying pricing:

* _normal_ &ndash; 85,20 PLN (approx. 20 EUR, 17 GBP or 20.5 USD); grants only entry to the event
* _Fan pack_ &ndash; 159,75 PLN (approx. 37.5 EUR, 32 GBP or 39 USD); entry + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + commemorative autographed poster
* _VIP pack_ &ndash; 213,00 PLN (approx. 50 EUR, 42 GBP or 51.5 USD); entry + special seats (ringside or bleachers) + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + 2 servings of drinks

#### Build-up
* Along with the event, PpW announced "the largest match in PpW history". This match is supposed to contain 20 competitors in a single ring, though the exact formula was not initially revealed. 
* [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) continued to cross paths ever since July. While Olgierd vowed to end Goblin, the latter always found a way to one-up him. At [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) Goblin interfered in a six man tag match, dragging Olgierd away on a dog leash. After weeks of social media build-up, PpW announced they would face-off in Dog Collar Match - the first in Poland.
* At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md), Pure Gold defeated the team of [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), Gustav's first loss of any kind since [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md)This gave '[Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md)' the leverage to demand another title shot, which Gustav accepted. It was later confirmed that the match is going to take place at March show and that Gustav is picking the stipulation
* At February 25th, details of 20-man match were clarified by PpW. It is going to be a _Royal Rumble_-esque battle royal, dubbed "20 typa, 20 broni" (roughly: _"20 dudes, 20 weapons"_). Rules are as follows
  * there are 20 competitors in the match
  * match starts with 2 wrestlers in the ring, next entrants come in every 90 seconds
  * over the top rope eliminaton, both feet must touch the ground
  * each wrestler is allowed to bring in a single foreign object
  * winner gets a match for [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) in the main event of Ledwo Legalne V
