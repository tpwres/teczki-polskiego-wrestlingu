Teraz Albo Nigdy (_Now Or Never_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), set to return to [Mi≈Ñska&nbsp;65](@/v/minska-65.md). This time, the show is set in a different part of the venue complex, _Hala Labo_.

PpW launched the ticket sales exactly two months before the event date. It is the first PpW event to introduce three tiers of tickets, with varying pricing:

* _normal_ &ndash; 85,20 PLN (approx. 20 EUR, 17 GBP or 20.5 USD); grants only entry to the event
* _Fan pack_ &ndash; 159,75 PLN (approx. 37.5 EUR, 32 GBP or 39 USD); entry + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + commemorative autographed poster
* _VIP pack_ &ndash; 213,00 PLN (approx. 50 EUR, 42 GBP or 51.5 USD); entry + special seats (ringside or bleachers) + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + 2 servings of drinks

#### Build-up
Along with the event announcement, PpW announced "the largest match in PpW history". This match is supposed to contain 20 competitors in a single ring, though the exact formula is as yet unknown.
