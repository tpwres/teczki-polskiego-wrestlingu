Teraz Albo Nigdy (_Now Or Never_) was an event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), set to return to [Mińska&nbsp;65](@/v/minska-65.md). This time, the show took place in a different part of the venue complex, _Hala Labo_.

PpW launched the ticket sales exactly two months before the event date. It is the first PpW event to introduce three tiers of tickets, with varying pricing:

* _normal_ &ndash; 85,20 PLN (approx. 20 EUR, 17 GBP or 20.5 USD); grants only entry to the event
* _Fan pack_ &ndash; 159,75 PLN (approx. 37.5 EUR, 32 GBP or 39 USD); entry + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + commemorative autographed poster
* _VIP pack_ &ndash; 213,00 PLN (approx. 50 EUR, 42 GBP or 51.5 USD); entry + special seats (ringside or bleachers) + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + 2 servings of drinks

### Build-up

* Along with the event, PpW announced "the largest match in PpW history". This match is supposed to contain 20 competitors in a single ring, though the exact formula was not initially revealed.
* [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) continued to cross paths ever since July. While Olgierd vowed to end Goblin, the latter always found a way to one-up him. At [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) Goblin interfered in a six man tag match, dragging Olgierd away on a dog leash. After weeks of social media build-up, PpW announced they would face-off in Dog Collar Match - the first in Poland.
* At [Hardcore Friday 21.000](@/e/ppw/2025-02-21-ppw-hardcore-friday.md), Pure Gold defeated the team of [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), Gustav's first loss of any kind since [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md). This gave [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) the leverage to demand another title shot, which Gustav accepted. It was later confirmed that the match is going to take place at the March show and that Gustav is going to pick the stipulation.
* On February 25th, details of the 20-man match were clarified by PpW. It is going to be a _Royal Rumble_-esque battle royal, dubbed "20 typa, 20 broni" (roughly: _20 dudes, 20 weapons_). Rules are as follows:
  * there are 20 competitors in the match
  * the match starts with two wrestlers in the ring; entrants come in every 90 seconds
  * wrestlers are eliminated by being thrown over the top rope; both feet must touch the ground
  * each wrestler is allowed to bring in a single foreign object
  * the winner gets a match for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) in the main event of [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md)
* On 1.03.2025 PpW released a [Facebook reel][gg-wybral], in which Gustav Gryffin chose his stipulation for the fight with Gabriel Queen - a 2 out of 3 falls match.
* At [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) [Biesiad's](@/w/biesiad.md) team defeated [Mister Z's](@/w/mister-z.md) and his men, including [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md). Now Marco wants wants a rematch against "The Strongest Carpenter".
* On 4.03.2025 PpW released an [Instagram reel][johnny-zwis] featuring [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) working at [2Koła](@/v/2kola.md). A mysterious assailant approaches him from behind and chokes Johnny out, revealing himself to be [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md). He then cuts a promo insulting [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) and urges him to come save his friend; then he decides to "go shooting", leaving Johnny tied up and hanging from the ceiling. Biesiad arrives and unties Johnny who relays Z's plans. Biesiad quickly realizes that Z went to _PM Shooter_ shooting range (currently PpW's sponsor) and gives chase.
* On 14.03.2025 PpW [announced][soldaut] on their Facebook that the event was sold out. A little later [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) reposted this on his Instagram, adding the number of tickets sold: 800, making this the biggest PpW show to date and one of the biggest shows in the history of the Polish wresling. (The only bigger show was [PTW#3](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md), however a lot of tickets for that event were given out for free, unofficially making Teraz Albo Nigdy the show with the most tickets actually paid for.)

#### Announced entrants for Battle Royal
