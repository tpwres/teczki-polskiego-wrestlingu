Miasto Bezprawia (_Lawless City_) was an event by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). The event was held in [Teatr Komuna](@/v/teatr-komuna.md), a performing arts venue that operates in a former school building. This was the first time PpW presents their show in Warsaw's city center.

#### Build-up to the event

* Previously on [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md), [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md) won a #1 Contender match for the championship held by [Steve Kuningas](@/w/steve-kuningas.md).
* Biesiad and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) both intervened in the [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) vs Chris X match.
* On social media, PpW posted that former MZW and PTW wrestler [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) has joined their ranks and is likely to appear in some capacity. This was confirmed with the release of the official poster. Later, another post announced PTW wrestler [Samson](@/w/samson.md).
* In a [facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/OficjalnePPW/posts/pfbid02zU3wXTw4DstxtdtphsXJQB3Q7wifMUxgXaYxsAiHfPzxMazGQPtTWYzTCUCfXe3Bl), PpW announced the number of participating wrestlers to beat any of their previous shows.
* Following the success of the joint MZW+PPW event [Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) will make his first appearance in PPW, in a three-person match that also includes [Samson](@/w/samson.md).
* Based on the poster, the show would also feature [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), Chris X, [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), Asara, [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Samson](@/w/samson.md) as noted above
* In a [Facebook video](https://www.facebook.com/OficjalnePPW/videos/263013170024297/), acting boss [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) congratulated Gryffin on his show-stealing performance at Turbo OG, and rewarded him with a match against Irish wrestler TJ Charles, with a stipulation of his choosing.
* In that same video, [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), who was Gustav's opponent, is announced to get a match against an unspecified opponent who would be making his debut for PPW, also with a stipulation of his choosing. This was later revealed to be Belgian wrestler MBM "Sweetboy", who competes all over the European scene, and the stipulation to be an _El Paso Outlaw Match_.

#### Recap

* With a table and two chairs set up in the ring, [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md), [Steve Kuningas](@/w/steve-kuningas.md) and [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) entered to have a staredown and contract signing for the main event.
* The El Paso Outlaw Match saw [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) enter on a toy horse, wearing a pink cowboy hat and shooting cap guns into the crowd. A botched table spot was successfully repeated post fight, to the crowd's great joy. The botch and repetition made it to Botchamania's facebook page, and later to [Botchamania 489](https://youtu.be/lGThcHUL5g0?t=516).
* Referee Yawara was given the nickname Leosia by the crowd, referencing her colorful hair similar to that of popular Polish hip-hop artist Young Leosia.
* [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) brought his signature high-flying style, unseen in PpW since [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md)'s retirement. The audience saw multiple close finishes on each of the contestants, and a three-person Tower of Doom. [Samson](@/w/samson.md) won with a frog splash to Shadow.
* After the 3-way fight, Michael HT introduced [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md), who strolls into the ring, in his signature robe, music blaring but to [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md)'s video package. On closer inspection, this turned out to be [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) in a fake bald cap, who then cuts a promo on Ricardo. Then the real Ricardo entered, and faced off Mister Z. During their segment, Gustav Gryffin walked outside the ring, inciting the audience.
* [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) entered to an excited audience, told them about his upcoming excursion to Japan, and how he created and trained his opponent. Then immediately turned heel by belittling the audience and Polish wrestling in general. Queen entered, to Hannah Montana's "Best of Both Worlds", immediately winning the audience. The two started by chopping each other, to have a strong-style duel.
* After losing, Crane starts to beat up Gabriel. An unexpected guest ran in to save his former tag team partner - [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md).
* Ricardo and [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) faced each other in an extremely bloody duel (mostly because of a botched bladejob that left Mister Z gushing blood onto the audience). The match ended with Ricardo lighting a table on fire, then being thrown into it by Mister Z once the flames expired. Huge reactions from the crowd. Mister Z wins to become the #1 Contender for the PpW Championship.
* Johnny, wearing new facepaint, and Biesiad began the action with music still playing, by throwing junk in the ring and attacking their opponents immediately. Many foreign objects were used, including a wooden frame with barbed wire, which of course Johnny had to get tangled in.
* After the fight, [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) offered a handshake to the winners. Biesiad rejected this gesture, but Johnny accepted. Chris X then betrays Isnorr with a chairshot. During this spot, the plastic seat of the chair flew off into the crowd, fortunately to no injuries.
* Later, Johnny announced that he's gunning to reclaim the PpW Ultraviolent title (from current champion Dobroniak), even if he must break the law to do it.
* [Feager](@/w/feager.md) and Kuningas was the hoss fight of the night, with very stiff hits. Feager wins with a Pedigree to become new PpW Champion. He got into an emotional celebration with the audience afterwards, as the show finished.
