TURBO OG was a wrestling event organized by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), on December 8th 2023, at the [2KOŁA](@/v/2kola.md) club.

The event's name references the previous [Back to the OG](@/e/ppw/2023-02-04-ppw-back-to-the-og.md) event at the same venue, and refers to the fact that 2koła is the original, first place that held their events, dating back to 2019 with [PpW 2KOŁA To My Nie Zarobimy](@/e/ppw/2019-12-07-ppw-2kola-to-my-nie-zarobimy.md).
Originally British wrestler Jack Harrop was to face [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) in the main event, however he was sidelined due to injury, and replaced with [Chris X](@/w/chris-x.md).
This was also the PpW debut of former [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) wrestler [Rafi Rarytas](@/w/rafi.md), complete with an immediate heel-turn.

## Aftermath

* [Feager](@/w/feager.md) won the right to face [Steve Kuningas](@/w/steve-kuningas.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/o/ppw.md#championships).
* [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) won by using Green Mist on Gustav, while [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) unsuccessfully tried to interfere in their match. After the bell, the angry Gustav accosted referee Borys. Once again [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) interfered, this time defending the referee, but that ended his alliance with Gustav, and he received a beatdown for it. [Jakob Sigmarsson](@/w/jakub-linde.md) appeared, revealing himself as Gustav's trainer and new ally.
* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) defeated Asara with a kick to his privates and some well-placed chairs.
* Biesiad and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) took the fight outside and shot fireworks at each other, among other weapons. Chris X interfered against Biesiad, following their rivalry from [Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md).
* The Christmas Massacre featured light tubes, Christmas glass baubles, and most importantly, a heavily padded and helmeted cameraman in the ring, hired by [Mandecki](@/w/jerry-mandecky.md) to record Johnny's defeat in high detail up close. At one point, he blinded Johnny with a camera flash to the face. [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) and Biesiad also interfered in the fight.
