Neomania III was PpW's early backyard show that took place on multiple dates over the summer holidays of 2013. The exact dates are unknown, however not earlier than 5.07.2013, as this was the day when [Jeff](@/w/michael-ht.md) and [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) signed a contract for a fight at this event during an episode of FightDown. The date of 12.07 was chosen arbitrarily for the purposes of this entry and does not accurately reflect the actual date(s) of the event.

The show was held outdoors at three different locations: a local playground, a "steel cage" (actually a chain link fence) surrounding a basketball court outside of Mati's house, and [Helit's](@/w/johnny-blade.md) garden. The fights in the first two locations took place on the grass (and, in the case of the playground, utilised slides, jungle gyms and other available equipment), whereas the garden featured a small makeshift ring made out of cardboard and an ordinary jute fibre rope tied to a metal post, a wooden beam and two trees.

### Recap

* The fights were commented live by the cameramen. Twice during the opening match the cameraman can be heard whispering to [Sin Cara](@/w/sin-cara.md), telling him the next move.
* The main event was the only match to have a referee. In the other fights the three-count was done either by the cameraman, or the wrestlers themselves.
* The video captions Johnny Blade as "Vince Mikelshot", however the [PpW wikia][ppw-wikia-vince] spells the name "Vins Michael $hot". According to a private conversation with Johnny Blade, this was caused by his sub-par knowledge of the English language and spelling at the time.
* Multiple times during the main event, the cameraman accidentally covered the camera's microphone, resulting in muffled audio.
* Candidate for the weirdest weapon in Polish wrestling (backyard or otherwise): Ultimo Combo attacked Mystic Tiger with a cotton bud.
* After the match ended, [the referee](@/w/mister-z.md) attacked Mystic Tiger, before being attacked by Ultimo Combo in return.
