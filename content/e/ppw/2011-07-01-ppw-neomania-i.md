Neomania was the inaugural show in the Neomania series of [PpW's](@/o/ppw.md) early backyard shows, and PpW's first "PPV" show. It took place on an unknown date(s) during the summer holidays of 2011, and it was held at a local playground. The date of July 1st was chosen arbitrarily for the purposes of this entry and does not accurately reflect the actual date(s) of the event.

According to [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), the name of the event derives from the derogatory Polish term "Dzieci Neo[strady]" (_Children of Neo[strada]_) used to refer to new Internet users, often very young and unfamiliar with the netiquette, who started appearing online with the rise of popularity of Neostrada, Poland's first broadband ADSL service, in the early 2000s (cf. [Eternal September][nooby]).

### Recap

* The only surviving video from the event is Ultimo Combo vs La Parka (Który nie jest prawdziwym La Parką ale to szczegół).
* According to the [PpW Wikia][ppw-wiki-neo-1], the full name of this version of La Parka appears to be "La Parka (Który nie jest prawdziwym La Parką ale to szczegół)". This translates to "La Parka (Who isn't the real La Parka, but that's a minor detail)". (The name was shortened in this entry for technical reasons.)
* The cameraman/commentator refers to La Parka (etc.) in the feminine grammatical gender, as "La Parka (_Która_ nie jest _prawdziwą_ La Parką ale to szczegół)" - most likely because in the Polish language, names ending with an "a" are almost exclusively feminine.
* When the first match begins, the cameraman says "But this has to be pretend, right?"
* Also, [PpW Wikia][ppw-wiki-neo-1] notes that [Black Tiger](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) was standing in for Pan Pionha (roughly _Mister Feest_), who no-showed the fight. A similar situation later happened at [Neomania II](@/e/ppw/2012-07-01-ppw-neomania-ii.md).
