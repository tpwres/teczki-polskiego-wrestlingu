Najlepsza Gala W Mieście [Hardcore Edition] (_The Best Show in Town_) was an event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md). It was the second show on PpW's tour of Poland, following [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md), and their first show in Gdynia. The event was held in {{ map_pin(v="Klub Svera") }}Klub Svera, right next to Gdynia's railway station, and just 700m from [Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md).

Much like the [first show of the same name](@/e/ppw/2022-11-25-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie.md) poked fun at [PTW #3: Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md) being held in Warsaw the next day, this show's name was a jab at [WWE Road to Royal Rumble](@/e/wwe/2026-01-17-wwe-road-to-royal-rumble.md), also taking place the next day (albeit not exactly in the same city).

Around 90 minutes after this show was announced, [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) posted to Facebook announcing [KPW Arena 31](@/e/kpw/2026-01-16-kpw-arena-31.md), also set for 16.01.2026. The two shows competed with each other for fans, although the KPW show started about 90 minutes earlier.

## Build-up

* The show was first mentioned by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) in his promo at [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md), and officially confirmed on 3.11.2025.
* The first fight to be announced - on 4.12.2025 - was [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) vs [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) in a No Disqualification Match.
* On 13.12.2025 PpW announced [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) vs [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md).
* On 16.12.2025 PpW posted a [video][z-w-kibelku] of [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) running into [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md), who confronts him and brutally forces him to agree to a match at the upcoming show. The next day it was officially announced as a Szwedzki Hardcore Match (_Swedish Hardcore Match_).
* On 27.12.2025 [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) & [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) were announced in a Tag Team Match against [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) & [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md), with the stipulation being that their victory will allow Gustav & Goblin to compete for the [PpW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ppw-tag-team-championship.md) against [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) at [Dwa Na Dwa](@/e/ppw/2026-02-28-ppw-dwa-na-dwa.md).
* A [video][ale-sie-bartek-zaplatal] published on 2.01.2026 saw [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md) request a Grand Fatherly Trial Match from [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md).
* On 6.01.2026 PpW posted to Facebook announcing a pre-show match between [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md), [Lady Killer](@/w/boro.md), [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md), [Antoni Ocean](@/w/antoni-ocean.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), in a Bring Your Weapons stipulation. This marks Sambor's return to the ring following an injury at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md).
* A 8.01.2026 post announced that [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) ([Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)) will appear at the show, although no further details were given.
* Two Hungarian luchadores, [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) & [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md), were announced on 11.01.2026.

### Recap

* Upon his entrance, and also later after winning the match, Mutant received "Bóg Jest Łysy" (_God Is Bald_) [chants](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#wrestler-specific), previously used to praise [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md).
* Michael HT announced Mutant as "Jebany Kurwa Mutant" (roughly _Bloody Fucking Mutant_), also on both occasions. In the video, the text just says Mutant.
* For the multi-man match, Antoni's weapon was his skimboard, Sambor brought in a sceptre, and Marcelito carried a very flashy, green glowing chair. Ladykiller initially brought in a bouquet of flowers with him, but later unwrapped it to reveal a wrench inside. Mutant's weapon was a huge snow shovel, which he put to good use.
* Gabriel Queen was visibly unhappy about being forced to join Rodzina, and especially being bossed around by Oskar. At one point in the match, Queen was holding Gustav in a front facelock, and Oskar was urging him to tag in. Instead, Gabriel let Gusvav go, and slapped Oskar hard in the face. This led to them getting physical in the ring, and almost granted Gustav a win by roll-up.
* Later in the match, after receiving a Green Mist from Goblin, a blinded Oskar grabbed and chokeslammed Queen, putting him out of competition and allowing Goblin and Gustav to grab the win.
* Immediately after the match ended, Zmowa's theme hit and out they came. Mister Zet derided Gustav and Goblin for believing they'd get their championship opportunity after beating Rodzina, something he could do himself right here right now. Instead, he put another obstacle in front of them, one he was quite sure they could not get past: Marco and Axel Fox. Only after defeating them would Goblin and Gustav advance to the championship match in [Wrocław](@/e/ppw/2026-02-28-ppw-dwa-na-dwa.md).
* Johnny came out to his match carrying a box of weapons and wielding light tubes. At one point in the match, he pulled out a stapler from the box, and a photo of Goblin which he then stapled to Plata's chest. This was followed by a second photo, this time of Mister Z, clearly referencing Plata's previous Trials matches, both of which he lost. Upon seeing the third photo, Plata snatched it and tore it up with his teeth. He then visibly regained energy, delivered a series of chops followed by a bodyslam to Johnny, and hit him in the chest and back with a barbed-wire-wrapped piece of wood. Johnny eventually recovered, and escaped an attempt to launch him into a barbed-wire board. He then smashed the light tubes on Plata's head for the win.
* Both opponents later hugged outside the ring during Johnny's exit, showing friendship and respect.
* Dobroniak arrived to the ring carrying a Żabka-branded (convenience store) paper bag with mysterious items inside. After some brawling involving other objects, he reached to it to produce a box of frozen meatballs, which he pelted Zet with, and later spilled to the floor for a comical pratfall by Zet. The next item was a small plastic bag, whose contents he described as [surströmming][surstromming], to make his opponent choke and retch. Finally, a rather thick piece of sausage he used to clobber Zet with. The latter two items were later tossed into the audience.
* The last weapon, used after seating Zet into a chair, was a massive fish, used to first pound and later also choke Mister Zet with. However, he managed to recover, kicked Dobroniak in the _köttbullar_, and DDT'd him into the fish. After setting up a table, laying out Dobroniak and a drop from the top rope, Mister Zet managed to win.
* The fish was a [bighead carp][carp] (_Hypophthalmichthys nobilis_), known in Polish as _tołpyga pstra_.
* For Gustav and Goblin's second entrance, their entrances and music pieces were swapped - Gustav first, then Goblin. They immediately started brawling, music still playing.
* The tag team match was contested as a very traditional tag team match, with no weapons or interferences. For most of the match, Goblin took on a lot of punishment from Zmowa, and was denied a couple of hot tag opportunities. Once inside the ring, Gustav started laying waste, receiving massive pop from the audience, which he turned into a 11-200 finisher on Marco to win.
* Robert Star entered with Rodzina members Oskar Alexander and Gabriel Queen, and a yellow football T-shirt of the local club Arka Gdynia, proudly displaying it to the fans. Later he handed it over to Queen, who was again visibly unhappy with it. In his pre-match promo however, he immediately belittled the local audience, then intimidated Max by asking him whether was it worth to travel for 8 hours from Katowice just to get squashed in two minutes, then insulted his parents for giving Max a dog's name.
* Max performed a dive spot from about 2m, climbing on some safety railing around a supporting column near the ring. Despite putting up valiant effort, he lost to Robert's Rockstar Cutter performed onto a chair. Fans later cheered him on with "Maksiu nic się nie stało" (lit. _Max, nothing has happened_) during his exit.
* Before the main event, Michael HT came out and plugged the upcoming shows, including the one [in Tokyo](@/a/ppw-hardcore-friday-the-13th-tokyo.md).
* The Biesiad vs Olgierd match featured each of the opponents being thrown into a sturdy wooden ladder. During the final moments, both wrestlers walked onto the entrance ramp, and Biesiad performed a running takedown onto a table below. This was followed by Referee Seweryn quickly counting them both out, despite Biesiad receiving a helping beer from fans nearby. Announcer Michael HT hesitantly declared a tie, to audience boos. The video shows medical staff quickly taking care of Olgierd's left knee.
