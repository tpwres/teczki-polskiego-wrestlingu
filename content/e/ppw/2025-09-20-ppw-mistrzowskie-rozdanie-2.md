Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2 (roughly _A Champion's Hand 2_) was a show by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), billed as a sequel to [a show from 2023](@/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie.md). It was held in [Mińska&nbsp;65's](@/v/minska-65.md) _Hala Labo_.

## Build-up

* The show was announced on 12.07.2025 in a [Facebook post][mr2] accompanied by the official poster. Keeping with the card theme of the [first Mistrzowskie Rozdanie](@/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie.md), this show's poster features [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) with his Third Eye open, and a number of tarot cards (modelled after the [Rider–Waite Tarot][rwt]) with the Major Arcana replaced with portraits of wrestlers.
  In Goblin's dexter is VIII - Strength ([Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md)) and in his sinister is XIII - Death ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)), while behind him is XVII - The Star ([Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md)).
  Goblin also holds two blank cards, numbered III and IV - The Empress and The Emperor, respectively.
* Tarot cards with character portraits taking place of the Major Arcana are an important element in the fantasy book series [The Chronicles of Amber][amber] by Roger Zelazny, however whether this was an inspiration or a coincidence, is not known.
* On 18.07.2025 PpW confirmed [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) vs [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md). Star was portrayed as XVII - The Star, and Goblin as 0 - The Fool.
* On 17.08.2025 PpW announced the main event - a Total Elimination Fatal 4-Way Match between [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) (VI - The Lovers), [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) (VIII - Strength), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) (XIII - Death) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) (XV - The Devil).
* On 22.08.2025 PpW posted a new graphic announcing "[Zmowa's](@/tt/zmowa.md) show of force", this time with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) as IV - The Emperor, flanked on the left by [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) as XX - The Judgemenent, and on the right by Olgierd as XIII - Death, and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) as XVI - The Tower.
* On 26.08.2025 PpW posted a [video][kabanosy-sa-na-podlodze] in which [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) tries to cheer up [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md), who lost his match at the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md), by offering him some [kabanosy][kabanosy-sa-na-wikipedii]. Angry and bitter, Oskar throws the sausages to the floor angering Dobroniak, who promises to "speak to Oskar's mother" at the upcoming show.
* On 3.09.2025 PpW announced a match between [Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) (XXI - The World; billed as Wujek - _Uncle_ - Dobroniak) and [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) (III - The Empress), for the custody of Oskar Alexander.
* On 6.09.2025 PpW announced [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) (X - Wheel of Fortune) vs [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) (V - Hierophant) in a Hardcore match.
* On 8.09.2025 PpW announced [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) (XVI - The Tower) vs [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) (XI - Justice).
* On 12.09.2025 PpW announced [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) (XVIII - The Moon) & [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) (IX - The Hermit) vs [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) (I - The Magician) & [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md) (XII - The Hanged Man).
* On 15.08.2025 PpW announced the continuation of "Plata's Grand Trials" (_Wielkie Testy Platy_), with [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md) as XIV - Temperance (misspelled as "Temprance").

### Recap

* Present in the audience was [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), proudly wearing his [ZLN GNG Championship](@/tt/zieloni.md#trivia). He was also invited to the commentary booth for Oskar & Agatka vs Dobroniak & Blade.
* After Rookie Antek entered for Bartosz Plata's Trial match, Joker announced that, because this was the third Trial, PpW decided on making it a triple threat match with a new opponent.
  Enter [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) in his unannounced PpW debut.
* Somewhat unusually, Marco Hammers entered the ring without Olgierd, nor did the match see any interference.
* Gustav delivered a massive Spinebuster to Mister Z, and later an 11-200 (Angels Wings) to Marco. 11-200 is the postal code for Bartoszyce, his hometown and the target of a [popular chant](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#wrestler-specific).
* After his turn, Gustav exited not through the ramp but the audience.
* Dobroniak comically no-sold much of Agatka's early offense. At one moment as Agatka was choking out Dobroniak, Johnny Blade walked into ringside, holding a plush Brainrot Tung Tung Sahur toy tied to the end of a stick, and used it to distract Oskar.
* Johnny then gave up the toy to Oskar, and proceeded to choke Agatka. Oskar soon joined, grabbing Johnny's leg but putting himself in Dobroniak's chokehold.
* Referee Kornel then grabbed a microphone and brought it to Dobroniak, who suggested the match should be replaced with a Tornado Tag Team, to which all present agreed. This replaced the advertised Oskar vs Johnny Hardcore match.
* Agatka countered Dobroniak by bringing in a pack of Dobroniak's favourite kabanosy, also tied to a string at the end of a pole. While a successful distraction, ultimately she angered him by throwing them on the floor, and ended up receiving them brutally shoved in her face.
* When Johnny was setting up the ending, planning to drop on Oskar holding his trademark ["Koniec"][koniec] (_End_) road sign plate, a hooded figure walked into the ring and shoved him off the top rope, then proceeded to deliver a cutter to Dobroniak, and helped Agatka pin him. The figure later revealed itself to be Robert Star, who thus became the newest member of their ["Family"](@/tt/rodzina.md) stable.
* An intermission followed that match, during which Joker interviewed wrestlers backstage, starting with the Hungarian luchadors, in English. Sentinel expressed interest in becoming PpW's tag team champions along with Wonder Haze.
* In his interview, rookie Antek revealed his ring name: Antoni Ocean, and expressed pride as the first PpW rookie to win his second match. He was quickly approached by Mister Z, who invited him to join Zmowa.
* Originally booked as a Classic Wrestling match, Goblin vs Robert was declared a PpW Rules match by the commentary team, after Goblin took the microphone and used some foul language to describe Robert's dishonourable deeds earlier that night. The match started with both wielding kendo sticks, and many other weapons followed soon.
* Goblin's pin attempt on Robert was interrupted by Oskar & Agatka who ran into the ring, with Oskar pulling Robert out of the pinning predicament and to the outside. However, they were soon countered by Dobroniak and Blade who also ran out to intervene.
