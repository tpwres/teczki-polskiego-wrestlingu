This event was a sideshow held as part of Poznań Beer Expo 2021. The event featured wrestlers from [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) competing against former backyard wrestlers, and several [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) regulars in their first, historic collaboration. PpW would return to that event two years later at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu](@/e/ppw/2023-11-24-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu.md), following another co-branded show in September the same year ([Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md)).

While this wasn't [Isnorr's](@/w/isnorr.md) debut for PpW, as that was a month before at the first [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md), he would become a regular competitor in PpW's ring from then on. As the hometown hero of Poznań, he won two singles matches and the rumble, for a very strong showing.

Some matches featured wrestlers thinly disguised with a mask, fighting as another, mostly comedic persona.

### Recap

* Isnorr pulled a large hammer from under the ring, and used it to attack Esteban, to later win with a spear on the stunned opponent.
* Johnny found a large construciton stapler under the ring. Warned by the ref that using it on his opponent would result in a DQ, Johnny stapled a card to his own chest. Later, he hit Adam with a kendo stick while the ref was looking away, and pinned him for the win.
* In the Royal Rumble match, after Direk was eliminated by Isnorr, he brought a wooden beach chair to the ring, and hit [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) in the back. [Hades](@/w/olgierd.md) removed the belt from Esteban's kimono and used it to choke its owner on the ring apron. Later, Hades fought Isnorr with kendo sticks. Isnorr won by a high kick to Hades to throw him off the corner turnbuckle onto the floor.
* PpW's [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) is billed as his former, backyard persona Cade Bruce. Later, he landed painfully on the barriers while brawling outside the ring. In the finish, missed a flying stomp, and ate a Helluva Kick from Charlie who then pins him.
* While outside the ring, Czacha stole a newspaper from an audience member, then sat on a chair to comically disguise himself. Esteban wasn't fooled, and hit him with a beach chair, followed by the actual chair Czacha was sitting on. Later Esteban found a piece of drywall under the ring, gorilla pressed Czacha into it, and followed with a splash.
* Immediately after the fight, Esteban demanded a new opponent, and [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md) answered.
* An exhausted Isnorr asked a fan to help him carry a table into the ring, to almost land on it immediately. Speared Hades into the table later to win.
