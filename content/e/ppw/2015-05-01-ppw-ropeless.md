Ropeless was an early PpW show from the backyard era, held outdoors at Winogronowa 17 street in Warsaw. It was their first event to feature a ring - one that was made from discarded mattresses, rugs, tires, floor mats and other junk. It didn't have the ropes in place yet, however, hence the name of the show. Aside from two cameramen, there was no audience.

#### Recap

* The show was recorded using two cameras - one shooting in 16:9 and the other in 4:3 with noticeably lower picture quality, resulting in a very uneven look of the video. Both cameras seem to have used fish-eye lenses, judging by the apparent deformation of ring posts near the edges of the frame.
* There was no referee; counting was done by one of the cameramen.
* There was no bell either; instead, a cameraman would exclaim "Ding-ding-ding!"
* The last two fights had non-diegetic music added in post during the match.
* The video never labels the wrestlers with their names. Johnny Blade, Mister Z and Rob Scaffold can be easily recognised from multiple PpW shows, however the winner of Electrico vs Superior is only made clear thanks to a cameraman's off-hand comment.
