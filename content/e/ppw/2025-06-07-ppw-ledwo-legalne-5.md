Ledwo Legalne 5 (_Barely Legal_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), set to take place on 7th of June 2025, at [Mińska 65](@/v/minska-65.md).

## Build-up

* At the run-up show [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), several matches were announced or confirmed:
  * In a contract signing segment, [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) selected the stipulation for his upcoming match against [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) - a Three Stages of Hell match. The stages are as follows:
    1. Classic Wrestling Match (contrary to standard PpW rules: no foreign objects, no interference)
    2. No Holds Barred
    3. Submission Match that can only be won via TKO (making the opponent pass out). It was billed as _W imię zasad: Walka do odciny_ (roughly: _In the name of principles: Fight till blackout_)
  * As [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) granted [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) the opportunity to fight him at this show, Biesiad immediately declared it to be a Cieśla (_Carpenter_) Match, presumably involving lots of furniture.
  * [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) challenged [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md).
* The Enigma Scramble match at the same show ended with three out of four wrestlers scoring one point: Sentinel, Wonder Haze and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md). All of them were granted a match at this show, with no further details given.
* At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) turned on his former friend [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), later explaining that he was fed up with Queen getting all the biggest chances, while he got nothing.
* On 22.05.2025 PpW confirmed that the match that Enigma Scramble contenders have qualified for, is going to be a six-man ladder match for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) number one contendership. With three spots still empty, PpW confirmed that additional qualifying matches will take place at their [Mystic Festival showcase](@/e/ppw/2025-06-04-ppw-mystic-more-brutal-than-metal.md).
* On 25.05.2025 PpW posted a [video][marco-dzwoni] of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) phoning [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md). He runs down all the matches that [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) has at the show and requests one for himself. Following up on his ladder spot from [Ostatnia Prosta](content/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), Marco calls himself a "ladder specialist", likening himself to Jeff Hardy. He requests being added to the Six Man #1 Contender Ladder Match. While the voice on the phone is never heard, Marco's reaction as well as the video's description confirm that the deal was made.
* On 26.05.2025 PpW posted a [video][szalony-profesor] containing lab diary of [Professor Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). In it, he lists various ways to get rid of [Johnny Zombie Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). One way is to kill the zombie, but that would also kill Johnny Blade. However, Dobroniak's research allowed him to discover a more humane way to beat Zombie Johnny - bathe him in non-alcoholic beer, which should cure his zombie affliction. Thus, Johnny Blade vs Stanisław van Dobroniak has been set up as an Undead Beerbath Match: Project Zero. Dobroniak vows to save Johnny Blade and become a hero of Polish wrestling.
* On the following day PpW officially announced the match. The [Facebook post][le-protocole] referred to the stipulation as "Protocole Zero" (note the misspelling of "protocol"), but the accompanying image kept "Project Zero".
