Ledwo Legalne 5 (_Barely Legal_) was [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md)'s major show of 2025, held on 7th of June 2025, at [Mińska 65](@/v/minska-65.md) in Warsaw, which is the same venue that held [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md).

## Build-up

* At the run-up show [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), several matches were announced or confirmed:
  * In a contract signing segment, [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) selected the stipulation for his upcoming match against [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) - a Three Stages of Hell match. The stages are as follows:
    1. Classic Wrestling Match (contrary to standard PpW rules: no foreign objects, no interference)
    2. No Holds Barred
    3. Submission Match that can only be won via TKO (making the opponent pass out). It was billed as _W imię zasad: Walka do odciny_ (roughly: _In the name of principles: Fight till blackout_)
  * As [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) granted [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) the opportunity to fight him at this show, Biesiad immediately declared it to be a Cieśla (_Carpenter_) Match, presumably involving lots of furniture.
  * [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) challenged [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md).
* The Enigma Scramble match at the same show ended with three out of four wrestlers scoring one point: [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md), [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md) and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md). All of them were granted a match at this show, with no further details given.
* At [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) turned on his former friend [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), later explaining that he was fed up with Queen getting all the biggest chances, while he got nothing.
* On 22.05.2025 PpW confirmed that the match that Enigma Scramble contenders have qualified for, is going to be a six-man ladder match for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) number one contendership. With three spots still empty, PpW confirmed that additional qualifying matches will take place at their [Mystic Festival showcase](@/e/ppw/2025-06-04-ppw-mystic-more-brutal-than-metal.md).
* On 25.05.2025 PpW posted a [video][marco-dzwoni] of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) phoning [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md). He runs down all the matches that [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) has at the show and requests one for himself. Following up on his ladder spot from [Ostatnia Prosta](content/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), Marco calls himself a "ladder specialist", likening himself to Jeff Hardy. He requests being added to the Six Man #1 Contender Ladder Match. While the voice on the phone is never heard, Marco's reaction as well as the video's description confirm that the deal was made.
* On 26.05.2025 PpW posted a [video][szalony-profesor] containing lab diary of [Professor Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md). In it, he lists various ways to get rid of [Johnny Zombie Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md). One way is to kill the zombie, but that would also kill Johnny Blade. However, Dobroniak's research allowed him to discover a more humane way to beat Zombie Johnny - bathe him in non-alcoholic beer, which should cure his zombie affliction. Thus, Johnny Blade vs Stanisław van Dobroniak has been set up as an Undead Beerbath Match: Project Zero. Dobroniak vows to save Johnny Blade and become a hero of Polish wrestling.
* On the following day PpW officially announced the match. The [Facebook post][le-protocole] referred to the stipulation as "Protocole Zero" (note the misspelling of "protocol"), but the accompanying image kept "Project Zero".
* On 5.06.2025 PpW announced the full line-up for the Six-Man Ladder Match: Sentinel, [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md), [Oskar Aleksander](@/w/oskar-aleksander.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) and Wonder Haze.

## Highlights

* For the ladder match, Marco Hammers dyed and shaved his beard to copy Jeff Hardy's look, and also used his entrance routine including music.
* However, in the actual match, it turned out he might have lied on his resumé, as he seemed to be afraid of heights, and needed a lot of time to scale any ladder.
* In a comedic spot, Marco found the smallest ladder available, about a meter in size, and called two referees to hold it down for him as he climbed.
* In the Undead Beerbath Match, Zombie Johnny was significantly slower and less resourceful than his usual self, but also quite more resilient, no-selling many of Dobroniak's attacks. However, he was finally tied down with a length of barbed wire, and carried to the non-alcoholic beer-filled bathtub.
* As Johnny woke up from his zombified state, he celebrated together with Dobroniak and the fans, both apparently forgetting about their rivalry for the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md).
* After an unfortunate ref bump, Gabriel pinned Vic but with no one to count. Moments later, Oskar Aleksander intervened unexpectedly, attacked Queen with a chair then handed it to Vic. Exiting the ring, he rolled the ref back in for a slow three-count on the badly beaten Queen.
* The "Cieśla Match" involved many tables, and many creative ways to break them. In a dangerous spot, a ladder nearly missed some of the crowd after being thrown out of the ring.
* Goblin's entrance routine fooled fans not once but twice: when the music hit, a character wearing the Goblin mask and his ring gear entered but remained standing in the entryway. He was followed by another one, wearing Goblin's white-and-green trunks. That was also not the real Goblin, who entered third, in a golden-painted mask, fire-motif trunks and new jacket with Goblin's eye symbol.
* In the main event's final No Holds Barred chapter, the wrestlers made a lot of callbacks to their previous matches and storylines. The barbed-wire crown from [Ledwo Legalne 4][ll4] made a return, as well as the chain with collars on both ends used in [Goblin vs Olgierd][teraz-albo-nigdy]. Gustav also lifted a section of the metal barriers into the ring, and used it on his opponent. Vicious belt strikes by Gustav called back to his [match against Samson][cozanoc].
* In the final moments, opponents were brawling outside the ring, when Goblin set up a table near the entrance, and climbed a steel structure for the final splash.
