Ledwo Legalne 5 (_Barely Legal_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), set to take place on 7th of June 2025, at [Mińska 65](@/v/minska-65.md).

## Build-up

* At the run-up show [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), several matches were announced or confirmed:
  * In a contract signing segment, [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) selected the stipulation for his upcoming match against [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md): a Three Stages of Hell match, starting with a Classic Wrestling Match, then going into a No Holds Barred, to eventually finish with a Submission Match. In this last segment, it's only possible to win when the opponent is beaten unconscious.
  * As [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) granted [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) the opportunity to fight him at this show, Biesiad immediately declared it to be a Cieśla (_Carpenter_) Match, presumably involving lots of furniture.
  * [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) challenged [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)
* The Enigma Scramble match at the same show ended with three out of four wrestlers scoring one point: Sentinel, Wonder Haze and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md). All of them were granted a match at this show, with no further details.
