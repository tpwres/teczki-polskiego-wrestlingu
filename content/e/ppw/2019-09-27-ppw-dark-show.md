Dark Show was PpW's penultimate backyard event and the last one to be held in the open air. It took place late in the afternoon, shortly before and after sunset, hence the name. It was held in the same small forest clearing as [Kiedyś Będzie Lepiej](@/e/ppw/2019-07-13-ppw-kiedys-bedzie-lepiej.md).

#### Recap

* During [Duende](@/w/sedzia-borys.md) vs [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md), referee Automatico answered a phone call while the wrestlers were brawling outside of the ring. He then announced he's got to go, so he did a fast count of "one-two-three-ten", thus ending the fight prematurely.
* For his match, [Automatico](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) wore [Biesiad's](@/w/biesiad.md) shorts.
