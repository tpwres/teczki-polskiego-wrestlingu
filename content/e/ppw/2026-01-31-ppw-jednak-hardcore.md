### Recap

* This time, [Istociarz](@/w/istociarz.md) handled commentary solo.
* Before the show, PpW started a poll for the [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) vs [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) stipulation. It was possible to vote by scanning one of the QR codes posted around the arena.
* In the pre-show match, [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) - an active [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestler - beat an [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) wrestler, [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md). This was the first such crossover on the Polish scene. Fux portrayed a strong babyface and quickly disposed of Sheen. Riverman inherited insulting chants previously reserved for ex-PpW star [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md): [_Tony Sheen, chuj ci w ryj_](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#wrestler-specific) (roughly: _Tony Sheen, suck a dick_).
* At the start of the show, Michael HT revealed the result of the fan vote. Fox and Gryffin would face off in a Falls Count Anywhere Match.
* In the opening match, Hungarian Luchadores faced the newly-formed tag team of [Antoni Ocean](@/w/antoni-ocean.md) and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md).
* [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) scored the fall for his team after hitting Sambor with a Super-Frankensteiner.
* In the next match, [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md) faced [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md). Mutant made his entrance carrying a snow shovel. He was announced as "Jebany kurwa mutant" (roughly _Motherfucking Mutant_). Biesiad made his customary entrance through the crowd, with a ladder and his custom "Cieśla" (_Carpenter_) beer. Crowd called Mutant "Olgierd z [Temu][tamtemu]" (_Olgierd from Temu_), probably due to his physical resemblance to Biesiad's current nemesis. Biesiad won with his usual Swanton Bomb from the ladder onto the table-laid Mutant.
* In next match, members of all the teams competing in the [PpW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ppw-tag-team-championship.md) tournament finals faced off. [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) entered first, followed by [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md). [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), making his entrance last, quickly jumpstarted the match. After some comedic shenanigans between Marco and Oskar, Oskar won by scoring a pin on Goblin.
* Injured [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) made his entrance on crutches, accompanied by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), and declared that he would not defend his [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) until the [Tokyo show](@/a/ppw-hardcore-friday-the-13th-tokyo.md). Mister Z suggested becoming an interim champion, an idea which Olgierd laughed off, laying his hands on his boss. Quickly collecting himself, Olgierd laughed off the tension, declared his loyalty and listed the Polish wrestlers who would not compete for the championship. Prompted by his name being dropped, Biesiad made his entrance, quickly chasing off Mister Z out of the ring, putting Olgierd's leg in a chair and threatening to re-injure him, unless he were given a titleshot. Mister Z threatened Biesiad with suspension if he did the deed, then Biesiad re-injured Olgierd anyway. Thus, Biesiad was suspended and Mister Z sent the members of the Ewenement Crew, referees, and wrestlers to escort him out of the arena.
* [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) ran into the ring, grabbing [Sędzia Seweryn's](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) hand, as if attempting to cash in a Money in the Bank Contract (which he didn't have). After a back-and-forth match, Queen won with a Wheelbarrow pinning combination. Fellow members of [Rodzina](@/tt/rodzina.md) made their entrance to congratulate him, thus transitioning into the break. The duo was available for customary [Instax][fotoszut] photoshoot with fans.
* After the break the show resumed with [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) vs [Ladykiller](@/w/boro.md). Representing Rodzina, Agentka Agatka made her entrance first. Ladykiller, announced as "Ladykiller" Boro, made his entrance wearing a leopard print bathrobe. Underneath the robe, Boro carried a bouquet of roses. Agatka accepted the gift, right before using it as a weapon. After some back-and-forth, Agatka beat Boro with a Satellite DDT.
* Next, there was an in-ring auction held, with a banner of [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md) at stake. It was sold for 1500&nbsp;PLN (approx. 357&nbsp;EUR, 308&nbsp;GBP, 65,290&nbsp;JPY or 422&nbsp;USD).
* The match between Gustav Gryffin and Axel Fox became a Falls Count Anywhere as per the previously mentioned fan poll. After some action in the ring, they moved into the crowd, fighting with various weapons including a trash can and its lid. Afterwards, in the ring, Gustav got busted open and Fox dominated him using a short rope. After Gustav thwarted a brass knucles attack from Fox, he hit Fox with an 11-200 (a postal code for Gustav's home town of Bartoszyce) and attempted to hit it again, only to be laid out with a chair by a black-clad hooded figure. Fox now succesfully hit Gryffin with the knuckles to score the win, with the mystery attacker standing still in the corner.
* After the match, Fox and the mystery attacker stared each other down, until Marco Hammers ran in to support Fox. After a brief confusion if the attacker was related to Zmowa, Oskar Alexander ran in with a chair and faced Zmowa. The mystery man joined him, revealing himself as Filip Fux. Agatka quickly joined Alexander and Fux, making Zmowa back down as Rodzina celebrated, welcoming their newest member.
* Lastly came the Main Event. [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) made his entrance wearing a Bullson brand motorcycle jacket. This prompted Michael HT to announce him as Johnny "Bullson" Blade. Blade brought in some light tube contraptions that he hid under the ring for later use. [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) made his entrance along with other Rodzina members (everyone minus the Patriarch, [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)), to the stable's theme song.
* Outmatched in strength, Blade quickly got dominated by Star, who used various weapons. Johnny's experience in hardcore quickly allowed him to turn the tables, getting the opportunity to hit Star with a light tube. They brawled on the stage and Star hit Blade with the Stallion Cutter onto (hastily emptied) audience seats. Going back into the ring, Star continued to punish Blade with weapons, trying to finish the match. Star placed a board in the turnbuckle and attempted to powerbomb Johnny through it. Johnny reversed the move and hit Star with a [bang snaps][strzelajace-diabelki]-covered hubcap, managing to incapacitate Star. Johnny set up two chairs and laid his light tube contraption on their seats, however the plan backfired when Robert Star powerbombed him straight through the light tubes. Star prepared some thumb tacks and attempted to hit Blade with the Stallion Cutter onto them, but the move was countered and Star took all of the tacks instead. This allowed Blade to make a comeback and finish him with a ["Koniec"][t-3] sign-supported splash.
* After the match, HT revealed that it was Blade's birthday, prompting the crowd to sing the customary [_Sto lat_][100], and other birthday songs.
* Two days after the show, on 2.02.2026, PpW issued the following official statement: "PpW Ewenement Wrestling Ltd. officially announces the termination of the employment contract with Pietrłomiej Biesiad, also known under the ring name »Biesiad Strong«, on the grounds of gross violation of the terms of the contract and not following the orders of his immediate superiors. This announcement is effective immediately, e.g. since 02.02.2026, and is not subject to appeal based on the labour code, nor the wrestling code of ethics. President of the company and executive producer: [Real Fuckin' Deal - Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md)."
