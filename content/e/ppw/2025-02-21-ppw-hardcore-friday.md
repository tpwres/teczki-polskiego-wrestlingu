Hardcore Friday 21.000 was a show by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), held on Friday, February 21st, 2025, in the [2KOŁA Motorcycle Club](@/v/2kola.md). The show was announced during the closing segment of [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), with tickets immediately available for purchase at the merch table.

## Build-up

* In a post-match interview at [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), Legia Łysych along with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) blamed [Referee Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md) for their defeat. [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) - visibly fed up with the referees - physically assaulted Kornel and challenged all of PpW's officials to a Gauntlet Match to "show them their place in the line". The match was officially announced on PpW's social media on February 2nd.
* On February 10th, PpW posted a video of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) challenging [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) to a match with any stipulation of Blade's choosing - except for his signature Hardcore Match. The match was confirmed the following day on PpW's social media.
* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) also confirmed that while Johnny's suspension is lifted, [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) is still suspended and he is going to get something "special" at the show.
* On February 13th, Johnny Blade posted a video of himself tending the bar at [2Koła](@/v/2kola.md) - his day job, now openly acknowledged in PpW storylines. While pouring vodka shots, he presents his choice of stipulation - a _Drunken Ambition Match_, or _Gra w melanż_. The rules are simple - whoever touches the ropes, needs to drink a shot of vodka. Later in the day PpW confirmed the match, officially naming the stipulation _Gra w melanż - wódka mecz_ (roughly "Party Game - Vodka Match"). \
  Despite Johnny naming it "Drunken Ambition", this stipulation is distinct from the identically named one that the German federation WxW sometimes uses. In WxW, a shot is poured only after a wrestler _grabs the ropes_ deliberately, including trying to force a rope break. In the PpW version, _touching the ropes_ for any reason, with any body part (including touching the ropes with one's back after being thrown) is penalised with a vodka shot.
* On 16.02.2025 PpW announced that Biesiad would have to face Mister Z's "special challenge" to earn his way back from his suspension.
* The day after that since [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) decided to go to Mexico instead of appearing at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md), he'd now have to compete in a "lucha surprise" match.
* On 18.02.2025 [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) was announced.

### Recap

* This was the first PpW event to be streamed live at the [PpW VOD][ppw-vod], after the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) experienced technical difficulties and streamed on YouTube instead.
* The live stream went offline a few times throughout the show, including during the final minutes of the opening match.
* In the show's opener, Goblin faced Sentinel, a masked luchador from Hungary who made his debut in the pre-show match of Gruba Przesada. Goblin managed to score a win over Sentinel via submission, after putting him in his new signature _Kabacki Krztusiec_ (modified Muta Lock).
* Mister Z introduced a big clock for the Beat the Clock challenge between Biesiad and himself. If Biesiad failed to beat the time set by Mister Z, he would be forced to serve as Z's bodyguard. Additionally, if either Sambor or Marcelito won their respective matches, they would earn a number 20 entry in the 20 person match at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md).
* Mister Z defeated Marcelito in 2:47 after hitting his Spinning Sit-Out Powerbomb, thus setting a time limit for Biesiad to defeat Sambor.
* Biesiad furiously assaulted Sambor with multiple chairshots and managed to pin Sambor, beating Mister Z's time and thus securing his freedom.
* _Rookie_ Bartosz was the one to accept Fox's open challenge, but before they engaged, Oskar's music started playing to the surprise of both. Axel then eagerly made the match a Triple Threat, which was won by him after he managed to hit a _Firefox Elbow Drop_ on Oskar Alexander while he was pinning Bartosz.
* The Vodka Match ended in a no contest, since neither contestant managed to get up to his feet before the referee counted to ten. Johnny Blade appeared to stand up just in time, but the [official results][hcf21k-wyniki] posted by PpW state there was no winner.
* Even Referee Kornel had to down a shot of vodka, after carelessly touching the ropes when motioning for the crew to pour one for Marco. He was careful to not touch the ropes afterwards.
* Tornado Tag Team Match ended after Vic Golden managed to secure a pinfall victory over Isnorr after hitting him with _Slayswitch_. Confronting Gustav after the match, Gabriel noted that it was Gustav's first defeat in 14 months. Gustav initially dismissed it, as it was Isnorr who ate the pin, but later agreed to a rematch (from [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md)).
* Since all three referees fought in the main event, the special guest referee for the match was [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md).
* For his guest referee role, Marco came out wearing a [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) T-shirt, which he later removed to reveal a referee's striped shirt underneath.
* Sędzia Kornel was the first referee to go against [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), and after a short fight he was defeated after being hit with Uranage by the bald hooligan.
* Sędzia Karol Górski appeared to revert back to his Madman Charlie persona during his bout. He managed to hit Olgierd with his signature Helluva Kick, but due to Olgierd's head durability, the attack didn't have the desired effect. Karol was knocked out by Olgierd, who managed to squeeze his head with his bare hands.
* Sędzia Seweryn was the last one to fight, and despite a strong comeback after avoiding Olgierd's falling headbutt and hitting a _Twist of Sew_, the drunken Marco only managed to count his pinfall to two. In desperation, Seweryn hit a suicidal headbutt on Olgierd's indestructible head, knocking himself out and allowing Olgierd to finish him off with a Tombstone Piledriver. 
* After the main event, Goblin attacked the victorious Olgierd and put a dog collar with a chain on him, in anticipation of the Dog Collar Match between the two at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md).
