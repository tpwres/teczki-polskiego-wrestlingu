The show was announced in the closing segment of [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), with tickets immediately available for purchase at the merch table.

## Build-up
* On February 10th, PpW posted a video of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) challenging [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) for a match with any stipulation of Blade's choosing - except for his signature Hardcore Match.
* The match was confirmed the following day in PpW's social media.
* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) also confirmed that while Johnny's suspension is lifted, [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) is still suspended and he is going to get something "special" at the show.
* On February 13th, Johnny Blade posted a video of himself tending bar at [2Koła](@/v/2kola.md) - his day job, now openly acknowledged in PpW storylines. While pouring vodka shots, he presents his choice of stipulation - a _Drunken Ambition Match_, or _Gra w melanż_. The rules are simple - whoever grabs the rope, needs to drink a shot of vodka. Later in the day PpW confirmed the match, officially naming the stipulation _Gra w melanż - wódka mecz_ (roughly "Party Game - Vodka Match").
* On 16.02.2025 PpW announced that Biesiad would have to face Mister Z's "special challenge" to earn his way back from his suspension.
