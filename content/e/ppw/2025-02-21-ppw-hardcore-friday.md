Hardcore Friday 21.000 was a show by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), held on Friday, February 21st, 2025, in the [2KOŁA Motorcycle Club](@/v/2kola.md). The show was announced during the closing segment of [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), with tickets immediately available for purchase at the merch table.

## Build-up
* On February 10th, PpW posted a video of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) challenging [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) for a match with any stipulation of Blade's choosing - except for his signature Hardcore Match.
* The match was confirmed the following day in PpW's social media.
* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) also confirmed that while Johnny's suspension is lifted, [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) is still suspended and he is going to get something "special" at the show.
* On February 13th, Johnny Blade posted a video of himself tending the bar at [2Koła](@/v/2kola.md) - his day job, now openly acknowledged in PpW storylines. While pouring vodka shots, he presents his choice of stipulation - a _Drunken Ambition Match_, or _Gra w melanż_. The rules are simple - whoever touches the ropes, needs to drink a shot of vodka. Later in the day PpW confirmed the match, officially naming the stipulation _Gra w melanż - wódka mecz_ (roughly "Party Game - Vodka Match"). \
  Despite Johnny naming it "Drunken Ambition", this stipulation is distinct from the identically named one that the German federation WxW sometimes uses. In WxW, a shot is poured only after a wrestler _grabs the ropes_ deliberately, including trying to force a rope break. In the PpW version, _touching the ropes_ for any reason, with any body part (including touching the ropes with one's back after being thrown) is penalised with a vodka shot.
* On 16.02.2025 PpW announced that Biesiad would have to face Mister Z's "special challenge" to earn his way back from his suspension.
* The day after that since [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) decided to go to Mexico instead of appearing at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md), he'd now have to compete in a "lucha surprise" match.
* On 18.02.2025 [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) was announced.

#### Recap

* This was the first PpW event to be streamed live at the [PpW VOD][ppw-vod], after the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) experienced technical difficulties and streamed on YouTube instead.
* The live stream went offline a few times throughout the show, including during the final minutes of the opening match.
* Mister Z defeated Marcelito in 2:47, thus setting a time limit for Biesiad to defeat Sambor.
* The Vodka Match ended in a no contest, since neither contestant managed to get up to his feet before the referee counted to ten. Johnny Blade appeared to stand up just in time, but the [official results][hcf21k-wyniki] posted by PpW state there was no winner.
* Even Referee Kornel had to down a shot of vodka, after carelessly touching the ropes when motioning for the crew to pour one for Marco. He was careful to not touch the ropes afterwards.
* Confronting Gustav after the match, Gabriel noted that Gustav's first defeat in 14 months. Gustav initially dismissed it, as it was Isnorr who ate the pin, but later agreed to a rematch (from [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md)).
* Bartosz was the one to accept Fox's open challenge, but before they engaged, Oskar's music started playing to the surprise of both. Axel then eagerly made the match a Triple Threat.
* Since all three referees fought in the main event, the special guest referee for the match was [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md).
* For his guest referee role, Marco came out wearing a [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) T-shirt, which he later removed to reveal a referee's striped shirt underneath.
* Sędzia Karol Górski appeared to revert back to his Madman Charlie persona during his bout.
* After the main event, Goblin attacked the victorious Olgierd and put a dog collar with a chain on him, in anticipation of the Dog Collar Match between the two at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md).
