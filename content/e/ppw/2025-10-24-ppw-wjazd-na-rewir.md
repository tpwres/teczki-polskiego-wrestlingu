## Build-up

* The event was announced on 21.08.2025 in a [Facebook post][w-breslau-bedziem], which also named a few of the workers: [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md), [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), and unspecified "local contenders" from [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md).
* The ticket sale commenced on 29.08.2025 on the usual Stage24 website. At the same time, PpW teased a "mighty surprise", to be unveiled in a few days.
* On the next day the promotion announced the return to wrestling and the PpW debut of one of the most experienced Polish workers - [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md).
* At [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) challenged [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) to a tag team match with any member of Rodzina (_Family_) against Queen and a mystery partner at the Wrocław show. Golden accepted.
* At the same show, [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md) confirmed in an interview that he would be present at the show in Wrocław.
* 22.09.2025 saw the announcement of the first match-up - [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) vs [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md).
* On 25.09.2025 it was revealed that Bartosz Plata would team up with [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) to take on the tag team of [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and the newcomer Antoni Ocean.

* On 4.10.2025 PpW announced an intergender match between [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), in a First Blood stipulation.
* On 8.10.2025 PpW posted a [video][smierdzace-gacie-joya] in which [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) talked about his return to wrestling, and dug out his signature blue trunks from a gym bag, strongly implying they haven't been washed since his [last match](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md). He then addressed [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), making him an offer he can't refuse: Joy ("plus his stinking undies") and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) vs Vic and "anyone from his family: his momma, his old man, his auntie, his momma's auntie - or [Oskar](@/w/oskar-alexander.md)".
