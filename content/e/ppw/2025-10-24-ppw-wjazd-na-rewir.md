Wjazd Na Rewir (roughly _Home Turf Invasion_) was a show by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), and the promotion's first tour show (not counting previous events attached to various festivals). It took place in {{ map_pin(v="Zaklęte Rewiry") }}Zaklęte Rewiry culture and entertainment centre in Wrocław.

## Build-up

* The event was announced on 21.08.2025 in a [Facebook post][w-breslau-bedziem], which also named a few of the workers: [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md), [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), and unspecified "local contenders" from [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md).
* The ticket sale commenced on 29.08.2025 on the usual Stage24 website. At the same time, PpW teased a "mighty surprise", to be unveiled in a few days.
* On the next day the promotion announced the return to wrestling and the PpW debut of one of the most experienced Polish workers - [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md).
* At [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) challenged [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) to a tag team match with any member of Rodzina (_Family_) against Queen and a mystery partner at the Wrocław show. Golden accepted.
* At the same show, [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md) confirmed in an interview that he would be present at the show in Wrocław.
* 22.09.2025 saw the announcement of the first match-up - [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) vs [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md).
* On 25.09.2025 it was revealed that Bartosz Plata would team up with [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) to take on the tag team of [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and the newcomer Antoni Ocean.
* On 2.10.2025 [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) was announced to take part in a Zmowa Recruitment Gauntlet Match, in which he'll have to face an unspecified number of opponents looking to join  [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) by defeating the former [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md).
* On 4.10.2025 PpW announced an intergender match between [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), in a First Blood stipulation.
* On 8.10.2025 PpW posted a [video][smierdzace-gacie-joya] in which [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) talked about his return to wrestling, and dug out his signature blue trunks from a gym bag, strongly implying they haven't been washed since his [last match](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md). He then addressed [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), making him an offer he can't refuse: Joy ("plus his stinking undies") and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) vs Vic and "anyone from his family: his momma, his old man, his auntie, his momma's auntie - or [Oskar](@/w/oskar-alexander.md)". It was officially confirmed the next day.
* On 17.10.2025 PpW shared an image of [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) teasing a "Very Huge and Very Important Announcement" to be made at the show. It is supposed to change the course of PpW forever.

### Recap

* There was a table set in the middle of the ring with something on in, covered in black cloth. [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) opened the show, making no comment on the fact. After a few minutes he was joined by [Joker](@/w/joker.md) and together they unveiled a new title: the [PpW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ppw-tag-team-championship.md). Michael then announced a tournament to crown the inaugural Champions, starting with [Surowy Klimat](@/e/ppw/2025-11-08-ppw-surowy-klimat.md).
* [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) assisted [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) by pulling her out of the way of [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), jumping from the top rope.
* Agatka won her match by hitting Blade with a Back-to-Belly Piledriver and then stapling a photo of another wrestler to his face before ripping it off, thus drawing first blood. Afterwards, Agatka literally poured salt over Blade's wounds.
* One of the staples stayed in Blade's forehead throughout the show, as he couldn't remove it easily by himself. He also decided it would make for a good argument in case anyone claimed the spot was faked.
* [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) cut a promo saying that him being in [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) was a mistake. He then faced, in this order: Emil Völler (from Germany; debuting in PpW); [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md) from [MZW](@/o/mzw.md)(whom he defeated in about a minute), [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md), Asara, and finally [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), whom he lost to. As Zmowa's leader himself won the match, nobody earned their spot as a new member.
* [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) hit [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) with a Golden Shower - [Pure Gold's](@/tt/pure-gold.md) signature finisher. Justin did the Running Drop Toe Hold, formerly performed by Vic.
* Before the main event started, Mister Z came out of the backstage and said that he's going to abuse his executive power by inserting himself and making it a Three-Way Match.
* [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) picked a section of the barriers to attack Mister Z with.
* At one point Biesiad pinned Goblin and Mister Z at the same time - the former with his hands, the latter with his legs.
* When Mister Z kicked out from Goblin's pin, the Acid Messiah shouted "Kurwa, ogarnij się!" (roughly _Get your fucking shit together!_), much to the crowd's amusement.
* Gustav ran into the ring with a kendo stick and hit Mister Z with it, in retaliation for his loss in the Gauntlet Match, thus helping Goblin secure the win.
