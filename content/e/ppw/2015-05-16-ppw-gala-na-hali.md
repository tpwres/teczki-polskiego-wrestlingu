Gala Na Hali (_An Event in a Gym Hall_) was an early PpW show from the backyard era, held indoors in a school at Gubinowska street, which some of the members of the promotion attended at the time. There was no ring and all the fights took place on mattresses - mainly in the titular gym hall but also outside of it, in a school corridor and an adjacent PE changing room. There was no audience and also no referee.

### Recap

* The commentator was only present in the recap section at the beginning.
* The fights had non-diegetinc music added in post, including the [John Cena theme][cena-za-kilo].
* At one point [Automatico](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) vs [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) became a three-man match, when [Ultimo Combo](@/w/johnny-blade.md) got involved.
* [Electrico](@/w/mister-z.md) vs [Matt2Hot](@/w/matt2hot.md) was kept as a surprise.
* The video never specifies which of the two wrestlers in the Main Event is [Matt2Hot](@/w/matt2hot.md) and which is [Electrico](@/w/mister-z.md). One needs to be familiar with them from other events.
