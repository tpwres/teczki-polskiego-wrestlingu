Ledwo Legalne (_Barely Legal_) was a show by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md) considered the official beginning of PpW's professional era. The show's name is a callback to 1997's Barely Legal by ECW, their first event broadcast live. It was also the first in the annual Ledwo Legalne series of supershows, focusing on payoffs to major storylines.
