PpW "Co Za Noc" (_What a Night_) was an event announced on 10.09.2024, and held on Saturday, October 26th 2024 by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). It tooke place in a brand new location - a post-industrial complex at Mińska 65 street.

Much like most of the bigger shows this event was streamed live on PpW's Youtube Channel free for all.

The show's name - "Co Za Noc" (which can be translated as "What a Night") comes from viral [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/k0nnjEmVHWs?t=157) published by polish influencer Robert Pasut and become popular rolling joke and sort of a catchphrase among PpW's fans and workers roughly since [PpW Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md).

### Build-up

* PpW announced a collaboration event for the show. Before and during the event, there will be an opportunity to get a tattoo, courtesy of tattoo parlour Syrena (_Siren_).
* To further bolster ticket sales, PpW introduced a student discount as well are "buy 5, get 1 free" discount.
* Many PpW personalities announced new merchandise items to be available at the show.

#### Storylines overview

* Huge part of the show was revolving around main conflict of two groups: Villainous ["Zmowa"](@/a/the-collusion.md) led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), and "Zmowa przeciwko zmowie" which was led by [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md). Nearly year-long feud of Mister Z versus Biesiad, as well as many other additional conflicts such as Pure Gold vs Legia Łysych finally imploded at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) after Biesiad and his allies challenged "Zmowa" for a "Ustawka Match", which is 5vs5 elimination no holds barred tag team match. 
* [Samson](@/w/samson.md) continued his rivalry with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). After a draw in non-title match at [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) and suffering a defeat in Anarchy Cyclone Tag Team Match at Hardcore Friday 2 Samson was eager to challenge Gustav for [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) in a strap match - the same weapon Gustav used to choke Samson during Hardcore Friday 2.
* [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) continued his crusade in the ultraviolent division going up against [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), which goes back to the [PpW Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) where Isnorr intervened in Blade's match. The rivarly later continued with Isnorr challenging Johnny for [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md) at [PpW Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), but without success. Isnorr then won Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match hosted by Blade, and later on defeated him in a tag team match at Hardcore Friday 2 therefore earning his opportunity to challange the champion for a rematch.
