Ewenement Haze was an event by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), taking place on Saturday April 20, 2024.
The original venue was to be [Waldorffa 25](@/v/waldorffa25.md), but due to miscommunication, it turned out that it's already booked for the night, and PpW had to find a replacement.
The new venue was Praga Centrum, a music and event venue with a large outdoor garden, located in Warsaw's Praga district.
According to Facebook posts, the ring wast to be set outdoors (for the first time since [Kiedyś będzie lepiej](@/e/ppw/2019-07-13-ppw-kiedys-bedzie-lepiej.md)), but only two days before the show the plans had to be changed due to the weather conditions and the show was held indoors after all.
The set featured a full stage and elevated ramp leading to the ring, with full size titan-tron display playing videos for wrestler's entrances.
The event's name refers to cannabis, whose many strains are often named "Something + Haze".
This in turn, is a reference to the date, which, together with the number 420 are often associated with cannabis culture.

The foreign guests for this event were:

* German wrestler Nick Schreier. In 2021, Nick, in his third ever match recorded on Cagematch, appeared for [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) at [Project 8: Golden Road Finals](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md).
* Danish wrestler Benny Bacchus, who competes mostly in Denmark and Sweden
* German wrestlers Joshua Amaru and Aytac Bahar, returning as a tag team. Their previous appearance was at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie](@/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie.md).
* Dominican wrestler Rambo, with 16 years of in-ring experience, mostly on the German scene. This is not his first time in Poland however: back in 2010 he appeared in a [tag team match](@/e/tbw/2010-06-05-tbw-2.md) for [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md).
* Ukrainian wrestler Alex Arthur. While this is his first appearance for PpW, he already wrestled for MZW a number of times, starting in 2016.

## Build-up

* Mister Z defeated Ricardo Diesel for the #1 Contender spot. PpW Champion Feager defends his newly won title in the main event.
* In the 4/20 ladder match, the object hung above the ring is to be a small bag of cannabis.
* Stanislaw Van Dobroniak is defending the PpW Ultraviolent championship against Alex Arthur. In a promo released on social media, he compared his opponent to a beaver, referencing a popular meme at the time.
* Nick Schreier, before the official announcement, leaked his involvement on Instagram, listing dates and cities of his bookings in April.
* Pure Gold (Gabriel Queen and Vic Golden) are set to appear in a tag team match, after their surprise reunion at the previous event.
* 7 matches and a [new ring](@/o/ppw.md#2023-prime-time-transfers-professional-ring-and-expansion) were confirmed on Facebook, in the post that advertised Baklava Club's involvement.

Winner: Goblin

Goblin and Benny share the stash, planning to smoke it from a bucket, but before they can complete the ceremony, Gustav Gryffin appears out of nowhere
and lays Goblin out with a chair, then bucket to the head for good measure. He steals the stash from Goblin, then cuts a promo explaining himself.
He wants revenge for his loss on [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) and challenges Goblin for a rematch at the next show.
The crowd urges Gustav to return the stash, so he rips the packet in half and throws the contents on the ground.

In comes Michael HT and starts an in-ring charity auction for Scooby the dog who requires urgent treatment... with everyone still laid out. The picture of the dog (signed by PpW roster) is sold for 1200 zł (about 280EUR at that time). The show goes to a break.

#### Break, interviews conducted by Joker

* Samson: he is not upset about his loss. He hints that his next match will be in singles competition.
* Gustav Gryffin (w/Jakob Sigmarsson): Gryffin says he does not care about morals, insults everyone and lays out his plan to become PpW Champion.
  He claims that attack on Goblin was a sign of care - drugs and alcohol hold Goblin back and he can become a better wrestler without them.
  Then tells the announcer to fuck off and leaves.
* Pure Gold - they are happy about their win and not much concerned about Baklava laying them out (just small itch in the balls). Asked about future opponents, they would like to fight Gustav Gryffin and a partner of his choosing.
* Isnorr: he confirms his plans to become PpW Champion. He thanks Biesiad Strong for igniting his passion towards hardcore wrestling and challenges Stanisław Van Dobroniak for the PpW European Ultraviolent Championship
* Rafi: he claims that he was cheated out of the win by a bad referee, calls PpW "fucking backyard". He insults Goblin and is happy for Gryffin taking away the trophy - as long as Goblin does not have it.
* Benny Bacchus: he's happy that Goblin won and wants to party after the show.
* Goblin: comes in, barely walking, Joker holds him up, and helps him sit down. Asked about Gustav, he says "I hate him, he stole my weed".
  Goblin says that Turbo OG match was not really meaningful to him, but now, Gustav made the issue personal. Goblin accepts the challenge, and wants it to be a hardcore match for #1 contender to PpW Championship.

#### Rambo v Biesiad Strong

Timestamp: `2:53:50`

The stipulation for this match is: Biesiad earns a contender match against Mister Z if he wins. However, should he lose, he gets his long hair shaved bald.

Timestamp: `3:18:07`

Mr Z makes his entrance to a chorus of boos and insults from the crowd.
Next comes PpW Champion, Bill Feager, to some pop. He's using Volbeat's "A Warrior's Call" song as his entrance theme now.
Before Michael HT gets a chance to start the formal introductions, Mr Z grabs the mic to cut a promo, putting down Feager as a paper champion and putting himself over.
He offers Feager a deal: to lay down for him in the middle of a ring. He gives the mic to Feager for him to announce his decision... Feager directs the mic toward the audience,
who are now chanting "kill him". He refuses, ridiculing Mister Z's "deals".

They start a match in a competitive way, countering each other's moves. The crowd is having none of it, they only want violence and tables.
Feager with Undertaker's legdrop to Z's head on the apron. He continues the assault, but Z makes a comeback, methodically working Feager's left knee,

They pass Feager by and enter the ring, Mandecky turns to Z, still seated in the corner.
Mandecky is clearly disappointed in Z, he shakes his head at him, looks at Bazooka and they both salute each other - it seems like he wants Bazooka to dispose of Mr Z.

Referee Kornel is unable to work after being busted open in previous match, so Michael HT announces his replacement.
Out comes Johnny Blade in a long leather coat.
He takes a mic to cut a promo. He says there is nobody crazy enough to officiate such a match - except for him.
Johnny drops his coat, showing a referee shirt underneath. He requests a deal: in exchange for officiating this match, Z is to lift his ban on Ultraviolent Championship titleshots.

Dobroniak celebrates over laid out opponent and referee and makes his leave. Blade and Arthur recover, they make their leave to cheers from the crowd.

#### Finale

Michael HT is reluctant to enter the ring once again, but eventually decides to. He announces that Jerry "Rich" Mandecky has been driven away outside Warsaw by a masked assailant named Kapitan Bazooka. He announces the next show, [Ledwo Legalne 4](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), "soon".

Additional interviews, once again conducted by Joker:

* Stanisław Van Dobroniak: brags about his win and his title run, nearly 600 days long. He's full of himself, calls himself a god, warlord, and king.
* Biesiad Strong: Joker asks him how many conspiracies he has thwarted, Strong jokingly remarks that all of them and one more.
  He promises to always stop conspiracies and do the same to Mister Z at the next show. Joker asks Biesiad to avenge Kornel, he asks if Kornel is part of any conspiracy.
  Joker denies, and Biesiad promises to avenge Kornel
* Rambo: He thinks Biesiad was lucky to win and blames his loss on Z's failed interference. He wants a rematch under No Holds Barred rules.
* Johnny Blade: Asked about the events from the championship match he refereed, Johnny does not care. He is happy about getting his title opportunity back and that's all that matters. He promises to beat Dobroniak for the title and leaves.
* Mister Z: Asked about his part in Rambo's loss, Z circles around the question. He says he couldn't stop himself from watching the match, he really wanted Biesiad to get bald.
  He will honor the deal - Biesiad won, so Z will face him. Blames his loss on Feager hitting Kornel with a chair, and gives himself a rematch.
  But to honor the deal with Biesiad, he adds him to the match, making it a Triple threat. Biesiad v Mister Z v Feager for PpW Championship is on for the next show. \
  Z mentions the stipulation that made Biesiad unable to challenge for PpW Championship ever again... but now that Mandecky is gone, and Z is the proper boss of PpW
  and not just executive producer, he lifts the stipulation. \
  Due to a contract between Mandecky and Z, should anything happens to Mandecky, Z legally succeeds him as the PpW owner. \
  Regarding Bazooka, he denies ordering him to attack Mandecky - Mandecky is treating everyone like dogs, so Bazooka just had enough.
  Closing comment from Z - are you all happy that I don't have a belt? But I have PpW! He flips off the camera.
* Alex Arthur: He feels like after a good fight. He likes the Ultraviolent belt, he showed he can hang with Dobroniak, so he wants a rematch down the line. Joker suggests a triple threat including Johnny and Arthur loves the idea. He leaves with a PpW chant toward the camera.
