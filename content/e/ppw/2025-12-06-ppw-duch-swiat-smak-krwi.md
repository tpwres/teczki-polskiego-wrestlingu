### Highlights

* Zmowa opened the show with a promo asserting their dominance and ambitions to capture both the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), and the upcoming [Tag Team Championship](@/c/ppw-tag-team-championship.md).
* Soon after Dobroniak entered the ring, wearing a Santa Claus jacket, with a supermarket-brand plastic bag in hand, and started to give out gifts to the wrestlers present.
  - Dobroniak pointed out that he had bigger pectorals than Marco, likening them to pepperoni, which the audience quickly caught onto and chanted at Marco. Next, Dobroniak addressed the fact that Marco likes to shoot up testosterone, but that makes "the guy not work in his pants". The gift for Marco was a blister packet of blue lozenges, presumably Viagra. Marco initially accepted, trying to hide the packet in his trunks, but angrily threw them away later.
  - According to Santa, Olgierd spends too much time online, especially on a Facebook fan group _Typowe WWE_. His recommendation for Olgierd was that he should get himself a girlfriend, and his gift was a lightly used ("had to test it myself", said Santa) porn magazine. Olgierd was quite happy with his gift, browsing it mid-ring with Marco joining in, until Dobroniak told him "the girl on page 12 reminds me of your mother".
* The 10,000&nbsp;PLN Battle Royal had some surprise debuts and returns:
  - [Boro](@/w/boro.md), announced as Lady Killer, wearing a pink singlet he hadn't used since his days at MZW (most recently at [Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md)). This was not strictly his debut, as he played one of the zombies at [Clash of the Creeps](@/e/ppw/2025-10-30-ppw_splat-clash-of-the-creeps.md), but at that show he was in heavy makeup. The match included his signature spot, donning a rubber glove and poking his thumb into the opponent's butt.
  - [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md), a former [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) and two-time [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) wrestler, in his debut for PpW.
  - [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md). While Tony wrestled for PpW at the [Wrocław show](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md), this was his debut in Warsaw.
* In the Fatherly Hardcore Match, Marco brought in an unidentified plastic jar, while Johnny carried a plastic bucket into the ring. One spot had him call Marco a "bałwan" (lit. _snowman_, but also a light derogatory term, akin to _moron_), paint his face white with some shaving foam and attempt to stick a carrot in his mouth. Later, after receiving a solid beating, Marco opened his mysterious jar and consumed a spoonful of the contents to regain his energy. However, he received a severe beating with Johnny's trouser belt, and lost by passing out due to Johnny choking him with another belt. As further punishment, Johnny shaved a piece of Marco's beard and planted the hair on Marco's head, giving him something new: a head of hair.
* For the Tag Team Match, Biesiad entered through the audience, beer and ladder in hand. However, Mister Z prevented him from using it, declaring the fight a Normal Match, a rare non-hardcore stipulation in PpW. However, the ending saw Dobroniak attempt to use a kendo stick, prevented by the referee. Dobroniak was pinned by [Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) after getting struck down with brass knuckles, behind the referee's back.
* Before the Chain God Realm Match, a brief intermission was held during which the crew replaced the ring ropes with steel chains.
* Olgierd entered wearing a new ring gear - switching from green-and-white to new red-and-white, with [ZLN GNG](@/tt/zieloni.md) on his left thigh, and "OG" on his right. As he entered, he dragged behind a chained, leashed PpW Crew member in a green Goblin mask, on all-fours.
