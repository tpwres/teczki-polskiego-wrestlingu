Gruba Przesada (roughly _Way Too Far_) was an event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), held once again in [Teatr Komuna](@/v/teatr-komuna.md) on Saturday, January 25th 2025.

The event saw three Hungarian wrestlers debut for PpW: masked luchadors [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) and [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md), and the powerhouse Atilla, in a pre-show match.

## Build-up

* On 24.11.2024 PpW social media posted a picture of an inverted cross, identical to the one that [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) wears as a tattoo on his chest, with a date of 25.01.2025 inside.
  Two days later PpW officially confirmed that Dobroniak, last seen at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), would make a return.
  Dobroniak posted a comment in which he slandered [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), implying a fight between the two - likely for the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md).
* The stipulation for the match between Stanisław Van Dobroniak and Isnorr was given to a popular vote via poll on PpW's official Instagram - a first in Polish pro wrestling.
  In a comment, Dobroniak asked fans to vote for the Bra and Panties Match. Various options were given, each referencing a video game:
  * _Donky Kong Weaponmaster Match_ - Donky Kong mascot is going to bring in the foreign objects
  * _Trophy Hunter Deathgames_ - competitors will be given various tasks in real time; first to score 3 points wins
  * _Heroes 3 Soundtrack Match_ - soundtrack from _Heroes of Might and Magic III_ will play throughout the match (with visual effects)
  * _Gothic CD-Disk Hellscape Match_ - inspired by the _Gothic_ game series, with CDs introduced as weapons.
* Eventually, "Donky Kong Weaponmaster Match" won the vote. In this type of match, a Donky Kong mascot will deliver the weapons at set moments of the match.
  PpW made it clear that despite an uncanny likeness in the promo materials, this character is distinct from _Donkey Kong_, a trademarked Nintendo character.
* On 2.01.2025 [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) posted a reel, in which he recapped [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)'s interferences in his "sacred" rivalry against [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md).
  He likened it to a fictional scenario where Władysław Jagiełło and Ulrich von Jungingen face off for the [Battle of Grunwald][bitwa-pod-grunwaldem], only to be met with Genghis Khan interfering - in this case, the "stupid Mongolian" would be Olgierd.
  He dared Olgierd to make good on his promises to "end" Goblin and "make Goblin his bitch" - likely challenging for a match at Gruba Przesada.
* On 3.01.2025, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and Gustav Gryffin posted a video where they recapped 2024 and made plans for 2025.
  They extended threats to most babyfaces on the roster, as well as an offer for [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) to join [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) and finally get on the winning side. A day later PpW confirmed on their Facebook that Fox would make his decision at Gruba Przesada - presumably in an in-ring segment.
* On 6.01.2025 PpW announced a Gauntlet Survivor Challenge match, in which [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) is set to face a number of, yet unannounced, opponents. If he loses even one fight, he is to be forcibly sent to [Monar][monar] for six months, presumably for a drug addiction rehab.
* On 21.01.2025, PpW posted Isnorr's reaction to the fans' choice of stipulation.
  Playing _Gothic 3_ on his computer, in a room decorated with _Gothic_ series memorabilia, he expressed his disappointment with the fans not choosing the _Gothic_-related stipulation for his match against Dobroniak.
  He recalled and regretted his time as Dobroniak's trainee, tearing down his career as mostly winning against "backyard guys" (_podwórkowcy_), his trademark insult.
  He called Dobroniak the "biggest backyard guy of them all". Responding to a threat of having a banana shoved up his rectum, he promised to wrap that banana in barbed wire and shove it in Dobroniak's mouth.
* On 22.01.2025, Mister Z posted yet another video. Sitting in his office, he makes a phone call asking an unknown interlocutor (presumably someone from the PpW crew) to relay a message that both [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) will not be making an appearance at Gruba Przesada.
  This came after a few days of Biesiad Strong teasing in his Instagram "notes" that his match would be announced soon. Reacting to the ban, Biesiad posted a short Instagram story, where he called Mister Z a "boy trying to play [Jerry Mandecky's](@/w/jerry-mandecky.md) role", among other insults. He promised to appear on the show nevertheless and destroy Mister Z.

### Recap

* This was to be the first show to be streamed live on the new [PpW VOD][ppw-vod]. However, due to technical difficulties with Vimeo, the show was streamed on YouTube instead.
* The commentary was provided by Joker, joined by Antek from the [Istota Wrestlingu][istota] podcast, under the name _[Istociarz](@/w/istociarz.md)_.
* Joker opened the show, and announced the pre-show match, before handing the mic over to Michael HT.
* At the pre-show, [_rookie_ Bartosz](@/w/plata.md) made his full PpW debut. Previously he'd made a handful of appearances at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu 2](@/e/ppw/2024-11-15-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu-2.md), but these were considered non-canon. He used a soundtrack piece from the videogame _Yakuza 0_ as his entrance theme.
* Goblin's gauntlet challenge saw two fairly competitive matches against Marcelito and Aron Wake. During Feager's entrance, unusally long even for his standards, Goblin took a seat in a fishing chair in the ring and started reading a fishing magazine, gradually ripping pages out and handing them off to the audience. The match itself lasted mere seconds, with Goblin spitting green mist in Feager's face and rolling him up for a three-count.
* At one point in Oskar vs Vic, Oskar's valet Agentka Agatka distracted Vic with a long kiss on the lips. The match saw many physcial interferences from her, a deviation from her usually standing on the entrance with a glass of unknown beverage (presumably alcoholic). Eventually, Vic got fed up with Agatka's antics, chased her around ringside into the ring and set her up for a _Killswitch_ finishing move - only to have the attempt thwarted by Oskar Alexander's big boot.
* Before the break in the show, [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) auctioned off the old ropes from PpW's ring.
* During the break, Vic Golden came out to the ring to take pictures with the fans. Backstage, Joker interviewed the wrestlers.
* Before his match, [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) cut his typical rambling promo, but this time in a babyface style. He called for [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) to face him for the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md), only to be taken aback by the news that the title now belongs to [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md).
* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) called out for Biesiad and Johnny Blade who are not making scheduled appearances tonight. Instead of them, [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) who was supposed to make his decision on joining [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) that night made his entrance. Z tried to coax him into joining _Zmowa_, using [Olgierd's](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers's](@/w/marco-hammers.md) presence as a physical threat to support his case. Fox, taking off his GobLis T-shirt, initially appeared to be buying in, but he slowly turned to insult each member of _Zmowa_ present in the ring, stating that he values friendship over success. This led to Blade and Biesiad making their appearance as "The Hardcores" and a brawl that turned into an impromptu six-man tornado tag team match between the babyfaces and the members of _Zmowa_. During the match, [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) made an interference, putting Olgierd on a dog leash and dragging him out of the arena.
* Donky Kong, the weaponmaster for Dobroniak vs Isnorr, was an unknown performer in a black monkey suit, and had his own entrance to Gloria Estefan's [Conga][conga]. This theme also played whenever Donky Kong came out to hand out new weapons, which were strongly banana-themed. These were, in the order of appearance:
  1. A banana, which Dobroniak forced into Isnorr's mouth.
  2. A piece of rope, which Isnorr used to choke out his opponent.
  3. A banana on a metal plate, which turned out to be the [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md) front plate. Fans briefly chanted for [DFW](@/o/dfw.md).
  4. Several bananas taped to a steel chair.
  5. A banana taped to Albert, the mannequin.
  6. Multiple bananas taped to a table.
* At one moment, Isnorr slipped on a banana peel thrown into the ring from the audience. A while later, he introduced a banana to Dobroniak's posterior.
* During his entrance promo, Gustav Gryffin told Gabriel Queen that he values his time, and introduced a timer of 15 minutes for their match, shown counting down on the titantron display.
* At one point, Gustav tried to steal a fan's beer; the fan wouldn't have it and instead splashed the beer on Gryffin.
* Around three minutes before the end of the main event, [Referee Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) was knocked out. The referee regained consciousness enough to count Gabriel's pin, but due to being still dazed after the hit to the head, Seweryn was slow to count. In effect, the timer ran out just one second before the ref counted to three, rendering the pin invalid.
