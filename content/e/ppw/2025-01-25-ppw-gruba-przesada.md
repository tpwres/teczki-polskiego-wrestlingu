Gruba Przesada (roughly _Way Too Far_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), set to return to [Teatr Komuna](@/v/teatr-komuna.md).

#### Build-up

* On 24.11 PpW social media posted a picture of an inverted cross, identical to the one that [Stanislaw Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) wears as a tattoo on his chest, with a date of 25.01.2025 inside it. Two days later, PpW officially confirmed that Dobroniak, last seen at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), would make a return. Dobroniak posted a comment in which he slandered [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), implying a fight between the two - likely for the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md).
* The stipulation for the match between Stanisław Van Dobroniak and Isnorr was given to a popular vote via a poll on PpW's officiall Instagram - a first in Polish pro wrestling. In a comment, Dobroniak asked fans to vote for the Bra and Panties Match.
