Gruba Przesada (roughly _Way Too Far_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), set to return to [Teatr Komuna](@/v/teatr-komuna.md).

#### Build-up

* On 24.11.2024 PpW social media posted a picture of an inverted cross, identical to the one that [Stanislaw Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) wears as a tattoo on his chest, with a date of 25.01.2025 inside it. Two days later, PpW officially confirmed that Dobroniak, last seen at [Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md), would make a return. Dobroniak posted a comment in which he slandered [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), implying a fight between the two - likely for the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md).
* The stipulation for the match between Stanisław Van Dobroniak and Isnorr was given to a popular vote via a poll on PpW's officiall Instagram - a first in Polish pro wrestling. In a comment, Dobroniak asked fans to vote for the Bra and Panties Match. Various options were given, each referencing a video game. Eventually "Donky Kong Weaponmaster Match" won - in this type of match, Donky Kong mascot will deliver the weapons at set moments of the match. PpW made it clear that despite uncanny likeness, this character is not _Donkey_ Kong - which belongs to Nintendo.
* On 2.01.2025 [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) posted a reel, in which he recapped [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)'s interferences in his "sacred" rivalry against [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). He likened it to a fictional scenario where Władysław Jagiełło and Ulrich von Jungingen face off for the [Battle of Grunwald][bitwa-pod-grunwaldem], only to be met with Genghis Khan interfering - in this case, the "stupid Mongolian" would be Olgierd. He dared Olgierd to make good on his promises to "end" Goblin and "make Goblin his bitch" - presumably challenging for a match at Gruba Przesada.
* On 3.01.2025, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and Gustav Gryffin posted a video where they recapped 2024 and made promises for 2025. They extended threats to most babyfaces on the roster, as well as an offer for [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) to join [Zmowa](@/a/the-collusion.md) and finally get on the winning side. A day later PpW confirmed on their Facebook that Fox would make his decision at Gruba Przesada - presumably in an in-ring segment.
* On 6.01.2025 PpW announced a Gauntler Survivor Challange match, in which [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) is set to face a number of, yet unannounced, opponents. If he loses even one fight, he is said to be forcibly sent to [Monar][monar] for six months, presumably for a drug addiction rehab.
