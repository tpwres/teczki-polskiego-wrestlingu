#### Recap

* Red Dorada vs Angel Guerrero is presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, whereas Red Power vs Mister Z is in 3:4. Judging by the cameraman's shadow, the main event was filmed with a phone held in portrait mode.
* According to the [PpW Wikia][ppw-wiki-neo-2], RoodWood and Red Dorada are the same person (also known as Mati), and his fight against Angel Guerrero was the first video uploaded to the PpW YouTube channel.
* No video from the Tag Team match is available, and the results aren't known.
* The [PpW Wikia][rej-mysterjo] describes their "Rey Mysterio" as a knock-off of the WWE contestant.
* Angel Guerrero was standing in for Pan Pionha (roughly _Mister Feest_), who no-showed the fight (just like at [Neomania I](@/e/ppw/2011-07-01-ppw-neomania-i.md)).
* Despite there being a commentator's table set up, with a person sitting behind it, the actual commentary for Dorada vs Guerrero was recorded separately by two people.
* The commentary for the main event was provided live by the cameraman, although [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) was at the commentator's table, calling the fight at the same time. The cameraman even points him out early in the fight.
* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) is announced as "hailing from Warsaw in Poland, weighing at... however many kilograms".
* The cameraman also seemed to double as a referee, by counting pins.
* There are two breaks in the main event, but it's never explained why.
* At one point in the match, Mister Z unintentionally removes Red Power's mask with his leg. Later on the situation repeated, when Mister Z rested his hand on Red Power's head while jumping from a jungle gym.
* Among the weapons used in the fight were a microphone, a Darth Vader mask, a drinking glass (that apparently happened to lie on the grass next to the fence), a crutch, a cardboard box and a garbage bin.
