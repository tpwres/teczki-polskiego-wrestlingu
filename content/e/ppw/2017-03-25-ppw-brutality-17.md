Brutality '17 was a backyard-era [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) show, staged on an outdoors ring located in a vacant lot at Winogronowa 17 in Warsaw.
According to [the Wiki][ppw-wiki-dzialka] this was PpW's main venue in that era, and belonged to the grandfather of someone called Lemur.
The Brutality series focused on hardcore matches, and featured the roster from their [Hardcore Friday][hc-friday-wiki] division.
True to the name, the main event of the show featured barbed wire, chain-link fence, panes of glass and light tubes taped to the ropes, among other items.

The main event featured Hardcore Icon, a guest from Halemba Power Wrestling (a backyard from Ruda Śląska) and their reigning Hardcore Champion at the time.
This was the final PpW show to use the old DIY ring.

#### Recap

* One of the fans kept drumming on a plastic roadblock barrier since the start of the main event. Perhaps fed up with it, Harcore Icon ended up throwing Johnny Blade at him.
* Midway through the main event, the referee hit Hardcore Icon with a light tube, prompting Johnny Blade to attack the ref.
* The Facebook event [announced][fb-event] a match between [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and [Feager](@/w/feager.md) for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), but it either didn't happen, or wasn't recorded.
* The Facebook event also had an image saying "Battle Royal", but that match is also missing from the video.
