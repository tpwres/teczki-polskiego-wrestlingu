### Recap

* According to the entry on [PpW wikia][neo-4-wikia], the show took place on 5.09.2015, which was a Friday. However, during Extreme Floorfiller vs KAT, a commentator stated "today is Thursday".
* The white balance for most of the video was set incorrectly, resulting in a blown out image.
* [Sun Ju's](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) name is misspelled in the captions as "Sun Yu". Likewise, Extreme Floorfiller is captioned as "Exstreme Floorfiller".
* Sun Ju, Superior and Rob Scaffold have the same shoes and shorts, indicating the same person under the masks. This was later confirmed by [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md).
* [Steven Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) was portrayed as an Olympic athlete, complete with the flag of Poland and an Olympic entrance theme.
* According to one of the commentators: "There used to be a tradition at Neomania, that it always opened with a pro vs backyard fight".
* The commentary seems to be about two seconds behind the events on screen.
* At one point during the Fatal 4-Way Match, [Ultimo Combo](@/w/johnny-blade.md) started fixing the ropes and the commentators asked not to pay attention to it.
* Hirinus pinned and eliminated both Superior and Ultimo Combo at the same time.
* The commentators explained the name of Steven's finisher, _Kakałko Splash_ ("Cocoa Splash"): "Steven takes steroids and he needs a nice steroid flavour, so he picked cocoa". They promptly then stated it was a joke, because Steven's naturally strong, but he does like cocoa (and is going to release his own brand of cocoa - to be availabe at a local shop where Johnny Blade used to work for a time).
* Per the commentators, referee Jędrek was found in a garbage bin, or was so broke he accepted any job, or worked for a garden maintenance company.
* The referee barely did anything in any of the matches, besides counting.
* The commentators kept mispronouncing "Feager" as /ˈfiː.dʒər/ instead of /ˈfeɪ.dʒər/ during his fight (but not later on).
* When put in a Tombstone Piledriver by Feager, Johnny Blade protected his head with his hand, much to a commentator's great amusement.
* At one point during his match, Feager attacked Blade with a plastic vuvuzela.
* During Extreme Floorfiller vs KAT, the commentator gave shoutouts to wrestlers from other groups: Lion and CMD from DWN, Patryk and Daniel from [DDW](@/o/ddw.md); [Krzysztof Jabłoński](@/w/chris-hunter.md) and [Rafał Orszak](@/w/rafael-kid.md) from [DFW](@/o/dfw.md); and Michał Wójtowicz from "WDW" (said to be an in-joke). They refer to DFW as a professional federation.
* Automatico won the first round by very conspicuously putting both of his legs on the ropes, which the referee didn't seem to notice (or care about).
* Around 3.5 minutes before the end of the show, a woman can be heard greeting the commentators, who respond in kind.
* Several seconds later the camera's battery died and the show cut to a second camera, this one using 4:3 aspect ratio (as opposed to the first one's 16:9).
* The video ends with the the two commentators getting out of their seats and commenting on whether or not their track did in fact record.
