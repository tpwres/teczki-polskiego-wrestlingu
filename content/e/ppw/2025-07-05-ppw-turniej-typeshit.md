Turniej TypeShit (_Tournament-Type Shit_) was a show by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md). The name of the show derives from [Internet slang][name], implying that it's just a regular tournament that everybody's familiar with. The show returned to [2KOŁA Motorcycle Club](@/v/2kola.md), and featured a namesake tournament for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) #1 Contender.

## Build-up

### Highlights

* Zmowa entered with Mister Z proudly brandishing the briefcase he won at [MZW Green Madness](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md) one week prior.
* Olgierd announced in his promo that he is now aiming for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md), while Gustav has to "step into the shadows" for now.
* After defeating Rookie Antek, Mister Z told Olgierd and Marco to hold him down, and decked the rookie with his briefcase. Then he handed it over to Gustav to do the same, which he did, but with visible hesitation and slight discomfort.
* Michael HT came out with Marco Hammers to announce that Marco's tournament opportunity is a gauntlet match.
* During his match with Agentka Agatka, fans ribbed the ultra-masculine, misogynist Marco with "Baba cię bije" (_A woman is beating you up_), to which he responded that her place is in the kitchen. Picking up on this, Agatka declared mid-maneouver that her place is not in the kitchen, but on the third rope, to great audience pop.
* Later in the match, Agatka hit Marco with a running hip attack. In a comedic spot, Marco seemed to actually be aroused by it and requested more, to her disgusted reaction.
* [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), playing mind games with [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), made a callback to their match at the first [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md), making his entrance to Hades's theme music and wearing Hades's signature mask. He brought a dog collar and chain from Olgierd's match against [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) as a weapon of choice and reenacted the infamous hanging spot from Ledwo Legalne. Johnny's weapon of choice was a Japanese barbed wire board. The match ended with Olgierd hitting a Tombstone on Blade onto the barbed wire board.
* Goblin cut a brief promo, stating that his championship reign, since he won the title at [Ledwo Legalne 5](@/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) almost exactly a month prior, started the Unhinged Era and that he'd love to celebrate it with a championship defense. Unfortunately, Mister Z did not allow him to do that. Instead, he will let an ambitious upcoming wrestler prove himself. With that, the match became one of Bartosz Plata's self-imposed Trials, and a rare face vs face bout.
* For his match, Gustav entered wearing street clothes instead of his signature singlet. While fans waited for Biesiad's entrance theme to hit, "Enter Sandman" by Metallica played instead. Then Biesiad entered, not through the entrance ramp, but through the front door and the audience, ladder in hand, smoking cigarettes, popping a couple of beers while standing on the ladder - the full Sandman entrace routine, as known from ECW.
* Finally, Biesiad entered the ring, set up the ladder, and popped one more beer on top of it. At that moment Gustav attacked him, pushing the ladder from underneath him - but Biesiad managed to hang on to metal beams high above the ring. That started the match, music still playing.
* Gustav and Biesiad brawled at the bar, in the audience, and finally also outside the venue. One spot had Biesiad push a large rolling garbage container at Gustav at high speed, causing him to painfully hit and roll on the ground. Plenty of headshots were exchanged using various items, many unprotected.
