Crossing Roads 2016 was an early backyard era [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) show, held outdoors at [Winogronowa 17](@/v/winogronowa-17.md) street in Warsaw. Like the [previous entry](@/e/ppw/2015-08-31-ppw-crossing-roads-2015.md), it was built around the clash of the rosters of the two PpW "weeklies": Hardcore Friday and Super Lucha.

#### Recap

* A turnbuckle broke early on in the first match.
* Black Orion tagged in Automatico who promptly tagged himself out, declining to change his partner.
* 2 Chamy attacked the [referee](@/w/biesiad.md), while Trzeci Cham entered the ring and jumped [Feager](@/w/feager.md).
* The Superior vs [Hades](@/w/olgierd.md) match was, according to the commentary, "a fight for the Multimedia belt, which we won't see physically here, which exists somewhere, in our heads, theoretically".
* According to one of the commentators, Team Lucha vs Team Hardcore was the first 3-vs-3 match PpW held since getting a ring.
* At one point during the 3 vs 3 match [a cameraman](@/w/michael-ht.md) switched duties with the referee, seemingly because the latter didn't realise he had to count when [Jim Enerico](@/w/mister-z.md) pinned [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md).
* [Hades](@/w/olgierd.md) was disqualified from the match for attacking [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) with an illegal item.
