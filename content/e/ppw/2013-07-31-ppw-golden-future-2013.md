Golden Future 2013 was a backyard-era [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) show that took place in [Helit's](@/w/johnny-blade.md) garden at an unspecified date during Summer vacation in 2013. Only two fights happened and the show was never completed, nor were there any further Golden Future shows in the following years.

The date of 31.07 was chosen arbitrarily for the purposes of this entry and does not accurately reflect the actual date(s) of the event.

### Recap

* The video starts with a recap from earlier shows: in the first one [Mystic Tiger](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) defeated [Dark Black Skull](@/w/mister-z.md) with a Hurricanrana and won Pas Skulla (_Skull's Belt_), and in [the other](@/e/ppw/2013-07-12-ppw-neomania-iii.md) [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) beat [Jeff](@/w/michael-ht.md) for the backyard-era version of the PpW Championship.
* The video then cuts to a wrestler in Mister Z's mask doing push-ups in his room, in which he addresses Mystic Tiger and recalls losing to him after being hit with a Hurricanrana. This introduced continuity errors with the two excerpts from earlier shows, plus at one point the person in the mask can be seen to have long hair - suggesting it was somebody else under that mask, as Mister Z typically had short hair.
* The commentary was provided on the fly by the two cameramen. Judging by the voice the first one was likely [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), which suggests Mike Ativ as the other.
* Mike Ativ was misspelled "Mike Ative" in the video. 
* Red Power hit a chair shot on Mike Ativ breaking the seat, and then proceeded to climb on the broken chair for an Elbow Drop.
* According to the commentary, Mike Ativ hit a suplex on Red Power at 6 minutes and 6 seconds into the match.
* Red Power hit Mike Ativ with a Red Piledriver after "clicking triangle" (per the commentator).
* At one point Filipet hit Angel Guerrero with a Flying Headbutt but Guerrero no-sold it, instead saying to the cameraman "That retard hit my fucking head!" (_Ten debil mnie pierdolnął w głowę!_).
* As Filipet was being pinned by Angel Guerrero and counted by the cameraman, the video cut off, followed by white text on black background saying "Nobody knows what happened to the contestants" (_Nikt nie wie co się stało z zawodnikami_).
