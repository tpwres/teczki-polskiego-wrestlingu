Dwa Na Dwa (_Two by Two_) was an event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), held in {{ map_pin(v="Zaklęte Rewiry") }}Zaklęte Rewiry event space in Wrocław.

## Build-up

* A [video][gobliffin] published by PpW on Christmas Day 2025 saw [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) convince [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) to join him against [Rodzina](@/tt/rodzina.md) in a fight for the [PpW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ppw-tag-team-championship.md).
* The first officially announced match, revealed on 13.01.2026, was [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) vs [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md). The two previously teamed up at [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md).
* At [PpW Najlepsza Gala w Mieście [Hardcore Edition]](@/e/ppw/2026-01-16-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie-hardcore-edition.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) & [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) earned their _Golden Opportunity_ to be added into the tournament finals.
* In [Rodzina's](@/tt/rodzina.md) [promo][promocja-rodzinna] recorded for social media, it was confirmed that [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) would be representing Rodzina in the finals, along with a new, not yet revealed family member. As it was [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) who advanced to the finals, it seems that the tournament involves the classic [Freebird Rule][freebird-rule] in some form.
* At [Jednak Hardcore](@/e/ppw/2026-01-31-ppw-jednak-hardcore.md), [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) - still an active [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestler - joined Rodzina, seemingly making him the "new member" to fight for the Tag Team titles.
* On 1.02.2026 PpW [confirmed][main-event-fuxem] Fux's addition to the tag team main event. They also disclosed the stipulation: a Tables Elimination Match with Tornado rules (every member of each team is active, no DQ), elimination happens by putting any member of the opposing team through the table, breaking it. The last team standing will become the inaugural [PpW Tag Team Champions](@/c/ppw-tag-team-championship.md).
* A match between [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Ladykiller](@/w/boro.md) was announced on 6.07.2026.
* Next came a Triple Threat Match between [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md), [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Asara](@/w/asara.md), announced on 11.02.2026.
* Emil Völler, who debuted at [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md), was announced on 13.02.2026 as the opponent of [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) in an International Hardcore Match.
* On 19.02.2026 PpW announced the debut of another active KPW wrestler, [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md). He will partner with [Antoni Ocean](@/w/antoni-ocean.md) in a Tag Team Match against [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) & [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md).
* A match between [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Ladykiller](@/w/boro.md) was announced on 6.02.2026.
* Two weeks later, on 22.02.2026, PpW announced [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md) vs [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md).
* After the main event of [Trzeba Być](@/e/ppw/2026-02-21-ppw-trzeba-byc.md), Johnny cut [a promo][johnny-postmatch], still bleeding, about how his wrestling journey since 2010 led him to fulfil many of his childhood dreams, but he never held the main championship title, and requested "one more chance" from current champion [Olgierd](/w/olgierd.md).
* Shortly afterwards, PpW released an [instagram story][tez-og], with Johnny looking at the PpW Championship belt laid out on the bar. Then, Olgierd appeared and took the belt, and asked how does Johnny still live after he [almost hanged him](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) once, and later threw him into barbed wire [upside down](@/e/ppw/2025-08-15-ppw-hardcore-friday-turniej-typeshit.md). Olgierd told Johnny that putting him down is one of his biggest dreams, however holding onto and defending the championship is even more important. But for old times sake, he'd give some though to Johnny's proposal and give him an answer in Wrocław.

### Highlights

* With this event, the ad-hoc team of Gustav and Goblin now had a name: "Bad Trip", complete with merchandise.
* Sambor was initially billed for the show, but did not make an appearance, instead the spot went to TOMCZAK in a surprise appearance. With this, the event saw 3 KPW wrestlers in total, two of them debuting for PpW.
* Marcelito, paired with monster heel Tomczak used some heel actions himself, choking one of the opponents in the corner with one of his green light strips. Hovewer, after a lost match, Tomczak confronted him and applied a devastating chokeslam, ending their brief partnership.
* The 3 Stages Of Man stipulation, as declared by Marco in his promo, was a series of short contests between him and Boro, in order to prove who's more manly.
  First, a race to do 30 push-ups, which Boro forfeited early, but Marco continued and even did jumping push-ups and one-handed push-ups for extra flair.
  The second round was a bodybuilding competition, with scores given by three "impartial judges", of which two were picked from the audience, and third was Michael HT. Both contestants needed oiling up for that, with Boro doing that on his own, and Marco receiving a very professional oiling from Referee Karol. Unfortunately, the judges rated Boro higher, which led to Marco arguing with them, turning his back to the opponent. Who then proceeded to oil up a rubber glove, and performed a surprise Oil Check on Marco, briefly putting him out of action.
  Lastly, the final round was a bodyslam competition, contested like a match that could be only won by bodyslamming the opponent.
* After his match, Johnny took the microphone, and demanded Olgierd come out and let him sign a contract for a [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) match. Olgierd obliged, referenced their last exchange and shared past, and let Johnny know how he was misled and used by Zmowa, seemingly ready to abandon them. Then he gave the contract to Johnny, who immediately signed it. This was met by mockery, with Olgierd stating that the contract needed two signatures, and he's unwilling to give his. Dejected but unfazed, Johnny managed to handcuff Olgierd to the ring ropes, and forcing a pen into the cuffed hand, managed to get his signature.
* In the main event, the rules were such that a team is eliminated when either member is put through a table. Despite Zmowa and Rodzina initially working together, a series of mishaps caused them to become hostile towards each other. At one point in the match, an early elimination was prevented by the unfortunate Referee Seweryn, pushed into one of the tables, breaking it with his body.
* Present in the crowd was [Rookie Two](@/w/rookie-two.md) from [KPW](@/o/kpw.md).
