Surowy Klimat (roughly _Rough Place_ or _Raw Aura_) was a show by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md). It took place in the Column Hall of [Mińska 65](@/v/minska-65.md), where [Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md) was held a year prior.

## Build-up

* On 6.10.2025 PpW announced that Antoni Ocean is going to prove his worth as a hardcore wrestler in a Trial by [Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) Match against the former [PpW European Ultraviolent Champion](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md).
* On 15.10.2025 PpW announced a Tag Team Match between [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) & [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) representing [Rodzina](@/tt/rodzina.md), and the masked Hungarian wrestlers, [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) & [Wonder Haze](@/w/wonder-haze.md).
* On 19.10.2025 a [short video][oskar-ma-przewalone] published by PpW saw [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) confronting [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) in defense of [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md). Oskar tells Queen that Agatka would beat him "any day, any time: Singles Match, Hardcore Match, Punjabi Prison, even in a Deathmatch", which Queen takes for a proposition and readily accepts, leaving Oskar beaming and Agatka fuming. The match was confirmed the next day.
* After [Gustav Gryffin's](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) involvement in the main event of the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md), "severe consequences" [were announced][komzegwendzje]. This is supposed to happen at Surowy Klimat.
* On 29.10.2025 PpW announced [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) vs [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) in an Anything Goes match.
* On 31.10.2025 PpW announced a One For All Tag Team Match, with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) taking on [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) represented by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md).
* Three days before the show, on 05.11.2025, PpW added a match between [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) and [Asara](@/w/asara.md), announced via a [Facebook post][speed-samurai-fb]. Both of them previously faced Gustav Gryffin in a Gauntlet Match at [Wjazd Na Rewir](@/e/ppw/2025-10-24-ppw-wjazd-na-rewir.md), and now they are set to face each other.

### Highlights

* The entire show was live streamed from one vantage point using a single camera.
* [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) ran out of the backstage and distracted the Hungarian Luchadores long enough to allow Vic Golden to score a pin.
* Asara kicked out out Max's pin extremely late, causing Sędzia Kornel to strike the ring for the third time a fraction of a second later. This prompted some heated ["było trzy!"](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#referee) chants.
* After the second match, Michael OG plugged the [upcoming show](@/e/ppw/2025-12-06-ppw-duch-swiat-smak-krwi.md) and its Japanese guests, referring to it as "real wresting above borders" - a jab at [PTW's](@/o/ptw.md) infamous slogan. Later, when announcing the Agatka vs Queen deathmatch, he called it a "total annihilation" - once again, poking fun at an upcoming [PTW show of the same name](@/e/ptw/2025-11-15-ptw-totalna-anihilacja.md).
* Instead of their usual ring gear, [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) came out wearing a white shirt and shorts while [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) had camo-patterned overalls.
* The weapons included a kendo stick, a garbage can, a light tube, a hubcap, a steel chair wrapped in barbed wire, a pizza cutter, Agatka's trouser belt and a table covered in roses.
* Queen dragged Sędzia Seweryn under the ring, took his shirt and threw him onto the ring. Agatka, mistaking Seweryn for Queen, attacked and pinned him; then Queen - wearing Seweryn's referee shirt - ran in for the three-count, briefly making Agatka believe she won the match.
* Oskar Alexander ran in to Agatka's aid before Queen could throw her at the table, only to be quickly disposed of by Queen. Then Vic Golden ran in with a steel chair, but Queen dodged his attack, which accidentally hit Agatka instead. After getting rid of Golden, Queen put Agatka through the rosy table to score a victory.
* After the match, Queen cut a promo challenging Vic for one last match at [Duch Świąt, Smak Krwi](@/e/ppw/2025-12-06-ppw-duch-swiat-smak-krwi.md) - the loser of which "forever gets the fuck out of PpW".
* As the crew was cleaning the ring of debris, the camera unexpectedly tiled and fell to the side.
* Robert Star got some "Polska kobyła" (_Polish mare_) chants, referring to his "Polish Stallion" gimmick.
* Biesiad came out through the crowd with a ladder a couple of beers.
* Biesiad threw the ladder to Star, who threw it back. A brief back-and-forth followed, before Star threw the ladder to Referee Karol Górski.
* Star grabbed a section of the guard rails and suplexed Biesiad onto it.
* After the match Michael HT asked the crowd to sing ["Sto lat"][prawie-marquez] for his sister, who had her birthday that day. The crowd happily obliged.
* Antoni Ocean came out carrying a DIY surfing board covered in coils of barbed wire. He lost the match after being thrown onto it by Johnny Blade.
* Axel Fox denied Goblin a tag allowing Zmowa to win. Mister Z then offered Fox his hand which Axel shook, thus turning heel and apparently joining Zmowa.
* Mister Z cut a promo after the fight and stated that Goblin would face Olgierd for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) at a future show.
