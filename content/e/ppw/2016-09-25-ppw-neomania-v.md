### Recap

* An image posted to the [Facebook event][fb-event] announced one of the wrestlers as Red Dorada, but in the official video he's referred to as Mati.
* Kevin Kevin answered a phone call while commenting the first match; he can be heard talking to his wife alongside Roger Kevin's commentary of the fight.
* The first match was followed by a video tribute to Mati, complete with a watermark of the trial version of AVS4YOU video editing software.
* At one point during his match, [Hades](@/w/olgierd.md) grabbed a light tube, got on a bicycle and hit Faust with the tube while riding the bike. Poorly superimposed over him was an animated horse.
