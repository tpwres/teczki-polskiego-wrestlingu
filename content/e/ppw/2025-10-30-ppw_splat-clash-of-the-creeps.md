It was the second show in collaboration with horror film festival [Splat!FilmFest](@/o/splat.md), following 2024's [Chcemy Krwi!](@/e/ppw/2024-10-30-ppw_splat-chcemy-krwi.md).

The event was free and open to the public,, in addition to the moviegoers present.

### Cosplay and characters

- Michael Myers, the antagonist of the _Halloween_ film series, was played by Gabriel Queen, wearing the signature featureless white mask and coveralls, wielding a chef's knife.
- Axel Fox was portraying Freddy Kruger from the _Nightmare on Elm Street_ film franchise. He was wearing the character's trademark red-and-green striped sweater, brown fedora and metal-clawed leather glove. However, he was not introduced as Freddy, unlike the other named characters.
- Oskar Alexander's costume referenced both Cactus Jack (as portrayed by American wrestler Mick Foley), and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Oskar wore the same red-and black lumberjack shirt as both of them.
- Pennywise, the antagonist from Stephen King's _It_, was played by [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md).
- Art The Clown from the _Terrifier_ series of movies, was represented by Gustav, who didn't have a full-face mask like the other clown, bur only facepaint. The crowd quickly recognized him, and a brief [Bartoszyce](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#wrestler-specific) chant was heard.
- The Necromancer was played by makeup artist Val Moren.
