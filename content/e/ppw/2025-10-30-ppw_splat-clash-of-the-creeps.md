Clash of the Creeps was an Halloween-themed PpW event. It was the second show in collaboration with horror film festival [Splat!FilmFest](@/o/splat.md), following 2024's [Chcemy Krwi!](@/e/ppw/2024-10-30-ppw_splat-chcemy-krwi.md). Like before, it was held in {{ map_pin(v="Kinoteka") }}Kinoteka, an arthouse cinema located in Warsaw's [Palace of Culture and Science][pkin-wikipedia]. The event was free and open to the public, in addition to the festival attendees present.

## Build-up

* As per the show's announcement, PpW wrestlers will not face each other at the show. Instead, they will face the monsters from horror movies (presumably cosplay-clad wrestlers).
* On 13.10.2025 PpW confirmed that [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md) [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) will make an appearance, taking wrestlers' side against one of the monsters.

### Cosplay and characters

- [Michael Myers][michalek], the antagonist of the _Halloween_ film series, was played by Gabriel Queen, wearing the signature white mask and coveralls, and wielding a chef's knife.
- Axel Fox was portraying [Freddy Kruger][fredek] from the _Nightmare on Elm Street_ film franchise. He was wearing the character's trademark red-and-green striped sweater, brown fedora and metal-clawed leather glove. However, he was not introduced as Freddy, unlike the other named characters.
- Oskar Alexander's costume referenced both Cactus Jack (as portrayed by American wrestler [Mick Foley][szpiczasty-jacek]), and [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Oskar wore the same red-and black lumberjack shirt as both of them.
- [Pennywise][tim-curry-bez-charakteryzacji], the antagonist of Stephen King's _It_, was played by [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md).
- [Art the Clown][artur-pajacewicz] from the _Terrifier_ series of slashers, was represented by Gustav, who didn't have a full-face mask like the other clown, but wore only facepaint. The crowd quickly recognized him, and a brief [Bartoszyce](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#wrestler-specific) chant was heard.
- The Necromancer was played by makeup artist Val Moren.
