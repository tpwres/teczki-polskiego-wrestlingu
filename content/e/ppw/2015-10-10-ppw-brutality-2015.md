#### Recap

* The commentators often referred to [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) as "Rob Hardy".
* At one point during [Combo](@/w/johnny-blade.md) vs [Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md), [Jim Enerico](@/w/mister-z.md) came out, slapped Scaffold and left.
* A little while later, a German shepherd interfered in the match, scaring Ultimo Combo. According to one of the commentators, this was the second dog interference in PpW's then-five year history.
* Rob Scaffold petted the dog, then petted Ultimo Combo who in turn proceeded to bite his leg.
* Red Floorfiller and [Feager](@/w/feager.md) had a "Star Wars" moment when they briefly fenced with light tubes.
* At one point Human attempted to attack referee [Enerico](@/w/mister-z.md), who promptly retaliated.
* Moments later [Jim Enerico](@/w/mister-z.md) climbed the top rope and jumped to the middle of the ring in order to start counting a pinfall.
* Red Floorfiller pinned Human while sitting in a garden chair on top of him.
* [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) taped a light tube to [Jim Enerico's](@/w/mister-z.md) back, before dropkicking it.
* The same match later featured a spinebuster and a Swanton Bomb onto a heap of dried twigs, including some wild roses.
