"Ale Grzeje" (roughly translated as _Heat Wave_) is an upcoming event by [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), scheduled for Saturday June 13th 2024. It's the second one to be hosted by [Teatr Komuna](@/v/teatr-komuna.md), after [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md).

The announcement post featured the show's official poster, focusing on the term "Zmowa" (roughly translated as _Collusion_), promising the hottest (literally and figuratively) show of the summer.
The hype text suggested "collusion versus collusion" - which refers to [Biesiad's](@/w/biesiad.md) plan to exact revenge, and thwart [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md)'s and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md)'s new alliance that screwed him of the PpW Championship belt at [Ledwo Legalne 4](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md).

Prior to the show, PpW is holding a 5-day open seminar with [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), which they call their "summer course".

### Build-up

* [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md) is returning from his three-month stint in Japan's BJW, and wants his rematch against [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md)
