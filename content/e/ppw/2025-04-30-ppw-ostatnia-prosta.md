Ostatnia Prosta (_The Run-Up_) was an event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), held in [Teatr Komuna](@/v/teatr-komuna.md) on April 30th, 2025. This show was the run-up to Ledwo Legalne 5, hence the name.

## Build-up

* On 2.04.2025 PpW announced an "Enigma Scramble - ?-Man Scramble Match", the rules of which are:
  * the exact number of opponents is left unspecified
  * the bout lasts 10 minutes
  * pins and submissions score points
  * at the end of the match, the wrestler with the most points wins
  * the winner gets a mysterious prize
* On 13.04 PpW posted the video of Biesiad held in custody and tortured by PM Shooter mercenaries.
* On 14.04 PpW posted the viddeo of [Jonny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) infiltrating the PM Shooter complex. He frees Biesiad and they try to run away. Just when they are about to jump the fence, Blade gets shot. Biesiad is taken back into custody, while the mercenaries dig a grave to bury the wounded Blade.
* On 16.04.2025 PpW's social media announced the first women's match in the promotion's history: Danish wrestler Madison Marley will face an unnamed [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md)-trained wrestler.
* On 22.04.2025 PpW posted yet another video in the PM Shooter saga. In this one, Mister Z can be seen honoring his deal with the PM Shooter mercenaries. He pays them in Peruvian artifacts and offers additional bounty in the form of the talisman of King Cápac if they finish Biesiad once and for all. This would mean humiliating him in the ring by sending the strongest mercenary to beat him. Mr Z will be the special referee.
* On 21.04, [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) posted a video of her call with Mister Z. She voices her displeasure in Madison Marley getting booked, as it undermines her position as the sole woman in PpW. She is thinking of a plan to get rid of Marley.
* On 23.04.2025 PpW announced that [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) would face Scandinavian wrestler Mr Power Up (PM Shooter's kayfabe representative), and that the match would be officiated by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) as the Special Guest Referee.
* On 25.04.2025 PpW announced the gate and bell time, mentioning that the pre-show match will take place roughly 15 minutes before the show starts.
