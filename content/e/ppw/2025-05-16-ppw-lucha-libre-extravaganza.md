### Recap & notes

* Luchadores spent all of the show at ringside, cheering both the _rudos_ and the _tecnicos_.
* Although every performer wore a mask, they were mostly wearing their usual ring-gear, allowing fans to easily recognize their regular personas.
* Mister Z was mistakenly announced under his original name, but wrestled in a mask of his old Electrico character.
* Grabollo was nicknamed "the largest luchador in Poland". He was unmasked during his match, briefly showing Gryffin's face.
* La Gatita vs Czacha saw a series of interferences from both sides, and the match devolved into a brawl between _rudos_ and _técnicos_, setting up the trios main event.
* La Gatita scored a win for Team Técnicos after a crossbody on Hirinus. He kept selling the defeat for a long time, even after Michael HT announced the show was over.
* Esteban Lucha no-showed the event.
