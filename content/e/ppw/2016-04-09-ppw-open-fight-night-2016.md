Open Fight Night 2016 was the second and last of two events in the Open Fight Night series. It took place at the vacant lot at Winogronowa 17. The idea of the OFN series was that anyone could challange anyone else.

The exact date of the event isn't known. The videos were uploaded on 9.04, 14.05 and 21.05.2016; the first date was chosen for the purposes of this entry, but may not accurately reflect the actual date(s) of the event.

### Recap

* The fights were quite heavily edited, with every transition being a quick crossfade instead of a simple cut. Some moves were show twice, from different angles.
* Additionally, there was no on-location sound. Music was added in post-production instead, resulting in a music video-like final effect.
* Rob Scaffold performed a Swanton Bomb from a high ground position.
* The middle rope turnbuckle broke off from the corner post after Hades crashed into it. A few moments later, after a crossfade transition, it was back in place.
* The count was apparently done by the camera operator(s). A few times during Z vs Hades a hand hand be seen from the camera's POV, showing the appropriate number of fingers after a pin.
* The main event was supposed to feature [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), but it had [Ultimo Combo](@/w/johnny-blade.md) instead, because "nobody knowns anything in this shitty Super Lucha".
* Unlike the other fights, Combo vs Floorfiller had a commentary and a referee.
* It was a comedy match, with the participants playing rock-paper-scissors and miming moves such as opening invisible doors, or Combo pinning the downed referee, while Floorfiller counted.
