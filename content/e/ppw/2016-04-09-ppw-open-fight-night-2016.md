#### Recap

* The fights were quite heavily edited, with every transition being a quick crossfade instead of a simple cut. Some moves were show twice, from different angles.
* Additionally, there was no on-location sound. Music was added in post-production instead, resulting in a music video-like final effect.
* Rob Scaffold performed a Swanton Bomb from a high ground position.
* The middle rope turnbuckle broke off from the corner post after Hades crashed into it. A few moments later, after a crossfade transition, it was back in place.
* The count was apparently done by the camera operator(s). A few times during Z vs Hades a hand hand be seen from the camera's POV, showing the appropriate number of fingers after a pin.
* The main event was supposed to feature [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), but it had [Ultimo Combo](@/w/johnny-blade.md) instead, because "nobody knowns anything in this shitty Super Lucha".
* Unlike the other fights, Combo vs Floorfiller had a commentary and a referee.
* It was a comedy match, with the participants playing rock-paper-scissors and miming moves such as opening invisible doors, or Combo pinning the downed referee, while Floorfiller counted.
