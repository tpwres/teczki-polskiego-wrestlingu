Trzeba Być (roughly _Gotta Be There_) was a show by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md). It take place in [2KOŁA Motorcycle Pub](@/v/2kola.md).

The [announcement post][byc-albo-nie-byc] promised a "new standard which will show that wrestling is art of the highest calibre". The show tickets will be strictly limited in number to just 150, and for the first time in PpW's history the main event will be a Dark Match - it won't be available on the official live stream, hence the show's name.

## Build-up

* The main evend dark match was revealed on 26.01.2026 to be an OG PpW Hardcore Match between [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md).
* On 5.02.2026 PpW announced that [Rodzina](@/tt/rodzina.md) - [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) and [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) - will fight at the show, but no matches were listed yet.
* The first match involving a Rodzina member was unveiled on 8.02.2026 - it was a Kiss My Foot Match between [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md) and [Bartosz Plata](@/w/plata.md), a classic rules match where the loser must publicly kiss the winner's foot.
* On 9.02.2026 [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) & [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) were confirmed to appear at the show, in order to "get some answers from the losers".
* According to a post made on 12.02.2026, [Zmowa](@/tt/zmowa.md) will appear at the show in an unspecified capacity.
* [Sentinel](@/w/sentinel.md) vs [Mutant](@/w/mutant.md) was announced on 14.02.2026.
* Two days later, following up from the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2026-01-31-ppw-jednak-hardcore.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) was announced to face [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) after the latter's chair attack at that event.
* On 17.02.2026 [Antoni Ocean](@/w/antoni-ocean.md) was announced to appear at the show.

### Recap

* The live stream suffered from major audio issues, with the same sound being played several times concurrently with different lags, making it impossible to make out. It was also too quiet, and Windows system sounds of a USB device being unplugged and plugged back in kept playing at regular intervals. The issue persisted until around halfway through the Triple Threat Match.
* [Istociarz](@/w/istociarz.md) was heard talking before the show started, including giving [Istotna Martynka](@/w/istotna-martynka.md) his PpW VOD password (but not the login).
* The show was streamed live using a single camera.
* [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) was present at ringside, purportedly as a regular fan, to support [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md).
* After the match ended, Biesiad entered the ring to stop Fox from attacking Goblin. As a result, Mister Z issued him a lifetime "stadium ban", and the Polish Carpenter was removed by a group of other wrestlers.
* During Plata vs Agatka, [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) ran up to the ring and distracted [Sędzia Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md), allowing [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) to clobber Bartosz Plata with a guitar to the back, and handing Agatka an easy win.
* [Istociarz](@/w/istociarz.md) mistook [Sędzia Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md) for [Sędzia Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md).
* The stream went briefly offline as Plata was about to kiss Agatka's foot.
* Before the next match an auction was held, where a full-size banner for [Jednak Hardcore](@/e/ppw/2026-01-31-ppw-jednak-hardcore.md) was sold to a fan for 350&nbsp;PLN (approx. 83&nbsp;EUR, 72&nbsp;GBP or 98&nbsp;GBP). 
* On 21:37 the crowd started singing [Barka](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#songs), albeit only briefly.
* Filip Fux and Gustav Gryffin fought outside the ring for too long, leading to the referee counting them both out, thus ending the match without a winner.
* After the bell, Fux and Gryffin continued brawling in the ring. After a short while, Jakub, Goblin and Oskar Alexander ran in and joined the brawl.
* The live stream ended before the main event.
