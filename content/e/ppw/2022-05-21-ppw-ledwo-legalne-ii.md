Ledwo Legalne II (_Barely Legal II_) was [PpW](@/o/ppw.md)'s sixth major event, held on Saturday, May 21, 2022. It was a follow-up to the first [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) event in 2021. The name of the show was a reference to a common trope in pornography, but also to the fact that back in 2021 COVID-19 restrictions were lifted barely enough so that holding a wrestling event became legal again.

The show is notable for being the first PpW event not to be held at the [2Koła motorcycle club](@/v/2kola.md), and for introducing the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/o/ppw.md#championships).
The event was held at Waldorffa 25, a dedicated event venue in Bemowo that would later become the main arena for PpW.

### Recap
* The commentary was only present in the Wong vs Feager fight, which was presented as highlights instead of a full match.
* [Skull Evil](@/w/skull-evil.md) was disqualified after attacking the referee.
* The legs of one of the table were broken and wouldn't hold correctly in place, so [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) simply dumped the table on Osamu.
* [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md) interfered and attacked Biesiad during his match with [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md), but Biesiad quickly disposed of him.
