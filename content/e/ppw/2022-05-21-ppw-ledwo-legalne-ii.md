Ledwo Legalne II (_Barely Legal 2_) was [PPW](@/o/ppw.md)'s 6th major event, held on Saturday, May 21, 2022. The name follows from the first _Barely Legal_ event in 2021, itself both a reference to adult movies, and the fact that back in 2021 COVID-19 restrictions were lifted barely enough so that holding a wrestling event became legal again.
It's notable for being the first PpW event not to be held at the [2Koła motorcycle club](@/v/2kola.md), and for introducing the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/o/ppw.md#championships).
The event was held at Waldorffa 25, a dedicated event venue in Bemowo that would later become the main arena for PpW.
