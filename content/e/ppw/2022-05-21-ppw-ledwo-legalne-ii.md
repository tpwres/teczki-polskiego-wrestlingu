Ledwo Legalne II (_Barely Legal II_) was [PpW's](@/o/ppw.md) sixth major event, held on Saturday, May 21, 2022. It was a follow-up to the first [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) event from 2021. The name of the show calls back to ECW's Barely Legal, their first event broadcast live. It may also relate to the fact that back in 2021 COVID-19 restrictions were barely lifted enough so that holding a wrestling event became legal again.

The show is notable for being the first PpW event not to be held at the [2Koła motorcycle club](@/v/2kola.md), and for introducing the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md). The event was held at [Waldorffa 25](@/v/waldorffa25.md), a dedicated event venue in Bemowo that would later become the main arena for PpW.

Several international wrestlers debuted for PpW at this event, most of them from Czechia:
* Czech wrestler [Asara](@/w/asara.md)
* Czech wrestler Skull Evil, who previously worked several matches for MZW between 2016 and 2018
* Belgian wrestler Steve Kuningas

Returning was also Czech wrestler Viking, Hardcore Champion of Prague-based VcV Original Wrestling, previously seen at [Brawl For The Puppies](@/e/ppw/2020-02-15-ppw-brawl-for-the-puppies.md).

### Recap
* The commentary was only present in the Wong vs Feager fight, which was presented as highlights instead of a full match.
* [Skull Evil](@/w/skull-evil.md) was disqualified after attacking the referee.
* The legs of one of the table were broken and wouldn't hold correctly in place, so [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) simply dumped the table on Osamu.
* [Tony Sk1n](@/w/tony-sk1n.md) interfered and attacked Biesiad during his match with [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md), but Biesiad quickly disposed of him.
