"Chcemy Krwi!" (_We Want Blood!_) was a PpW event held in collaboration with horror film festival Splat!FilmFest, on October 30th, 2024.
The venue was Kinoteka, an arthouse cinema located in Warsaw's [Palace of Culture and Science][pkin-wikipedia], specifically its lounge/bar area.
The event was free and open to the public, so while the festival moviegoers made a sizable chunk of the audience, fans not interested in the movies
also attended the show.

Despite the name, no blood was on display at this event save for [Johnny Blade's](@/w/johnny-blade.md) back, already bloodied from his Trial by Metal and Glass match on [Saturday](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md).
The event was also not streamed on PpW's regular channels, though a fan-stream by Istota Wrestlingu is available.

## Storyline overview

This event was non-canon. Host [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) announced that "today we're in a different reality, where weird things may happen".
PpW also teased only two fights on their social media: [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) in a Halloween Street Fight, and later [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) to face his "biggest nightmare".

### Recap

* Gustav cuts a promo about how the PpW booker and owner Mister Z called him in the middle of the night to book him for this show. Next, his opponent enters, wearing black trunks and a black lucha mask, whom Gustav initially failed to recognize.
* The match pitted two champions against each other: Gustav with his new, white PpW championship belt, and Mister Z, wearing the previous, black-strapped version, the same one Gustav retired at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md). Host Michael HT announced this to be a title belt unification match.
* Winner: Gustav by submission.
* Olgierd enters wearing a Jason Vorhees hockey mask, Friday the 13th style, in tune with the festival's theme.
* After Olgierd entered, Biesiad's theme hits (Thunderstruck by AC/DC). However, the lead part is played on a [banjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Ao-iNPPUc) and the vocals don't match.
  Fans accept it as part of the "different reality" and start chanting for Biesiad. In comes Oskar Alexander, dressed in Biesiad's signature camo pants, black T-shirt, and with his hair down, imitating Biesiad's entrance routine.
  Olgierd is incensed, says he wants the real Biesiad. Then the proper AC/DC version of the theme hits and Michael HT starts announcing Biesiad, but Biesiad throws a chair into the ring and starts brawling immediately, cutting off the announcement and music.
* The opponents battle with chairs and kendo sticks, and Olgierd forms a temporary alliance with Oskar.
* At one point, with Oskar laid out on a table, Biesiad introduces a ladder by throwing it at his opponent
* Winner: Biesiad by pinfall on Oskar after crashing him through a table.
* Like at the [previous event](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md), Isnorr came out carrying an axe.
* Fox and Isnorr brawl out in the crowd, on stairs, and at the bar, including a jump from the counter by Fox.
* Winner: Isnorr by pinfall.
* Michael HT announces that Goblin was to be Johnny's opponent, however he went missing in the vast cellars below the Palace. The crew set out to search for him, and even tried to lure him with a Kustosz (budget beer brand).
  However, the creature who snatched the beer was someone else.
  In comes Goblin, but with red facepaint - Michael announces him as Gremlin. He carries with him a black bag in the shape of a body, with Goblin's signature mask on it, and proceeds to piledrive it, followed by a couple of elbow drops and a legdrop.
* This new Gremlin character is more feral, walks hunched, and communicates only in grunts and shrieks. Apparently he's also afraid of loud noises, because Johnny scares him with a small bicycle horn. He offers candy to the audience and to Johnny, who initially refuses to accept them. When he does, he immediately starts choking.
* The fight sees creative use of pumpkins: Johnny plants one on Gremlin's head, turning him into a Jack-o'-lantern. Later, Gremlin uses a small pumpkin as a weapon.
* Johnny introduces a wizard's hat to the ring and pulls out something from it, which scares Gremlin, causing him to comically flip around. This turned out to be a decorative spider, and Johnny later spills a number of them from the hat and into the ring.
* Gremlin lifts Johnny into a powerbomb position to hurl him into a table in the corner, but Johnny manages to counter into a headscissors takedown onto the same table. Johnny follows with his signature splash holding a [T-3 road sign plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Poland#Complementary_plates) that says "End".
* Winner: Johnny Blade by pinfall.
* Afterwards, Johnny rolls up Gremlin into a bodybag, and stands victorious over him, holding the roadsign.
