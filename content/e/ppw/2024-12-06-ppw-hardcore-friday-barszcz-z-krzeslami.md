{% timeline() %}

#### Opening

* Timestamp: `0:00:22`
* [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) enters the ring and greets the audience. The crowd chants "OG!"
* HT hypes up the crowd into screaming "Wesołych Świąt!" (_Merry Christmas!_) and generally warms up the crowd.
* [Sędzia Karol Górski](@/w/madman-charlie.md) enters the ring as HT introduces him, and crowd is chants his name.
* After a while Michael HT announces the first fight - a Fatal Four Way Match - and remarks that the winner would be given a special gift from Santa.

#### Fatal Four Way Match: Olgierd vs Oskar Alexander vs Gabriel Queen vs Goblin 

* Timestamp: `0:06:02`
* The head of masked [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) peeks from behind a curtain, but as he makes his entrance it becames clear that the Acid Messiah is in fact portrayed by [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) who stole his ring gear. Olgierd takes off Goblin's outfit and hits it with a couple of headbutts.
* [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) makes his babyface entrance next.
* [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) is the third one in this match. He makes his way to the ring supported by Agentka Agatka - his manager - who sips her vodka martini, standing on the stage throughout the match.
* Goblin finally makes his entrance wearing one of the Olgierd's merchandise shirts with many invectives written on it. He immediatly takes on the charging Olgierd and the two brawl backstage.
* The match is filled with many spots and continous change of initiative every few moments. Olgierd is mostly focused on fighting Goblin, while Oskar fights Gabriel Queen.
* Queen and Goblin occasionaly team up to fend off Oskar and Olgierd, but have some opportunites to exchange blows with each other.
* One of most memorable spots from the fight would be the chaotic exchange of powerful moves between wrestlers started by Goblin performing a Top-Rope Sunset Flip Powerbomb on Olgierd and finished by Oskar Alexander powerbombing Gabriel onto Goblin and Olgierd laying in the middle of the ring.
* The second memorable spot was the simultaneous four-way submission with wrestlers submitting each other at the same time.
* Finally, Gabriel Queen wins the fight after hitting his new finisher - a Running Lariat - on Oskar Alexander.
* Winner: Gabriel Queen by pinfall.

#### Segment: Gifts from Santa

* Timestamp: `0:22:35`
* Immediately after the match, HT announces the arrival of a special guest.
* The special guest is [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) dressed as Saint Nicolaus. He is announced as the patron saint of carpenters - Święty Biesiek (_Saint Biesiek_).
* Biesiek gives out presents to the audience - among many gifts he hands out are some beers and Christmas-themed decorations.
* Finally St. Biesiek pulls out the gift for the winner of the Fatal Four Way Match - a contract for [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) match at [PpW Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), which he supposedly stole from Gustav's invoice folder he held for Mister Z.
* Gabriel Queen reads out the details of the contract out loud, declares that he is "coming for Gustav's ass" and signs the contract.

#### Santa Biesiad vs Feager 

* Timestamp: `0:28:24`
* [Feager](@/w/feager.md) makes his entrance to the ring. Biesiad declares that his opponent will also recieve a gift. He pulls out some vodka and condoms from the bag, strongly suggesting that Feager should "Drink, have sex and F-off".
* The match beggins and lasts for about 20 minutes. [Sędzia Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md) is the referee but due to the match's impromptu nature, it is most likely a hardcore match by default.
* The match is full of objects such as chairs, ladders, tables, sledgehammers and even a Christmas tree from the stage.
* Finally, the match ends after Santa Biesiad hits Feager with his signature move from the top of the ladder.
* Winner: Biesiad by pinfall.
* After the match, Biesiad celebrates for a while when the ringcrew cleans up the ring.

#### Hardcore Match: Isnorr (c) vs Marco Hammers - PpW European Ultraviolent Championship Open Challenge

* Timestamp: `0:54:18`
* The [PpW European Ultraviolent Champion](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md) Isnorr makes his way to the ring. He cuts a short promo where he announces that he will host an Open Challenge for his championship.
* [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) is the one who anwsers Isnorr's call. He makes his way to the ring, while his tag team partner - Olgierd - sips a beer on the stage.
* For the most of the fight Marco is the one who gets dominated by Isnorr. Marco visibly struggles while using most of the foregin objects - unlike Isnorr, who is capable of getting the upper hand almost every time.
* Finally Hammers is able to control the situation long enough to get a half of a lighttube. He celebrates with it just to smash it on Isnorr's head. The reigning champion seems to be resistant to that type of weaponary and just brushes off pieces of glass from his hair before picking up a chair and smacking Marco's head with it to score a pin.
* Winner: Isnorr by pinfall.

#### Break

#### No Outside Weapons, Non-Title Match: Gustav Gryffin vs Johnny Blade

* Timestamp: `1:28:00`
* HT announces that this match will be officiated by [Sewi The Referee](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), who makes his entrance to the ring.
* [Johnny Blade's](@/w/johnny-blade.md) music hits, but instead of coming from behind a curtain, he makes his entrance from the [2 KOŁA's](@/v/2kola.md) bar.
* [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) makes his way to the ring wearing his work suit - a pair of jeans, a shirt and a blazer. He cuts a short promo where he says that Blade is not worthy enough for him to even change into his ring gear, so he will defeat him in his normal clothes. He also states that he made a deal with Mister Z, saying that Johnny is forbidden from bringing any objects from ringside to fight Gustav - otherwise he will be suspended as an in-ring performer.
* Gustav visibly dominates throughout the match, constantly keeping Johnny down with his wrestling moves. Blade tries to fight back with his strikes, but Gustav always gets the upper hand.
* This situation changes when Johnny cleverly overcomes the "No Outside Weapons" rule by using Gustav's leather belt, which is legal in this fight. He strikes Gryffin's back and attempts to choke him with it before hitting him with a top-rope Splash.
* Gustav shows off his viciousness by kicking off from said Splash and transforming that into his own attack. After that he visibly plays with the beaten up Blade, breaking his own pinfalls just to mock his opponent. After he's done with that he treats Johnny with a Ripcord Lariat to finish the match.
* Winner: Gustav Gryffin by pinfall.
* After the match Gustav continues his beatdown on Blade and tries to hit him with a Piledriver onto his Championship belt laying in the ring. He is however interrupted by his next opponent, Gabriel Queen, who makes a save.
* Gabriel Queen puts on a pink glove and sticks his thumb into Gustav's anus - making a reference to a fellow [Greens](@/tt/zieloni.md) member [Boro](@/w/boro.md), who did such a move as Lady Killer. After that he takes the PpW Championship from Referee Seweryn to celebrate with it, hyping up his fight against the beaten & humiliated Gustav.

#### Christmas Street Fight Match: Mister Z vs Axel Fox

* Timestamp: `1:48:49`
* [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) makes his entrance to his "GobLis" tag team theme.
* Fox's opponent, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), is the second one to enter the ring. They begin to brawl almost immediately, once Fox manages to lay his hands on his opponent.
* The whole fight is brutal and filled with vicious spots. At one point Axel's head starts bleeding after he is struck with a metal trashcan.
* The fight takes place both in-ring and at the ringside, where both of the wrestlers brawl in the crowd. Besides that a lot of objects are used in the match - most notably the kendo stick, which is the weapon Mister Z used to attack Axel Fox on numerous occasions.
* The fight seems to be very close, but at the end Axel is the one to get the upper hand and set up the PpW producer on a table for the Firefox Elbow Drop. He is however interrupted by Legia Łysych. Marco tries to interrupt him but gets beaten down, however Olgierd also arrives carrying tied-up Goblin, which makes the Polish Fox lose focus long enough for Mister Z to recover and Powerbomb Fox through the table to finish the match.
* Winner: Mister Z by pinfall.
* After the match Mister Z along with Legia Łysych celebrate over the beaten up GobLis.

#### Ending

* Timestamp: `2:10:15`
* After Zmowa leaves the ring the crowd is chants "GobLis", while both members of said tag team slowly recover from the beatdown and hug it out before leaving the ring.
* Michael HT thanks PpW Fanatics for attending the show. He sums up 2024 as one of the most important years for PpW and announces that this is just the beggining for Ewenement. He thanks everyone who helped out during every PpW show and reminds the crowd that [the next show](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) will take place on 25.01.2025 at [Teatr Komuna](@/v/teatr-komuna.md) and the tickets are avaliable right now.
