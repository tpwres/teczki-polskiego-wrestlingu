#### Recap

* All fights except the main event are presented as highly edited highlight reels instead of full matches.
* One of the fans recorded the show by holding up a laptop computer.
* During the Hardcore Tag Team Match one of the fans hit himself three times on the forehead with a piece of light tube which didn't break, but to his apparent surprise, it hurt. After the final bell, the same fan walked in front of the camera hitting himself on the head with a full light tube, this time breaking it.
* Young vs Hades featured a guitar shot, not often seen in Polish wrestling.
* At one point during this match the [referee](@/w/biesiad.md) attacked one of the fans, probably for placing a steel chair on a ladder seconds before [Hades](@/w/olgierd.md) threw Jake Young at it. It was the same fan who'd previously hit himself with a light tube.
* A short while later, the same fan threw a sword into the fray; this prompted a cameraman to call him "fucking [Snake](@/w/snake.md)".
* Another rarity in Polish wrestling: Hades wrapped the sword with some rags, doused them in liquid barbeque fuel and set them ablaze, before attacking Jake Young with it.
