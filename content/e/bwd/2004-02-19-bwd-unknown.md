### Recap

* The BWD website announced the day and the month, but the year was only discerned from the date a later comment by Kid Crusher, posted to the BWD guestbook.
* The provisional card was announced alongside the date. The comment by Kid Crusher corrected one of the items on the card, meaning others might be incorrect as well.
* Crusher's comment says "as far as I know there was a show yesterday, and according to what I remember, I'm the one who fought KAT" (_o ile wiem to wczoraj byla gala i wedlug tego co pamietam to ja walczylem z katem_).
* The initial announcement said there could be other people in the Royal Rumble. Whether or not there were, is unknown.
