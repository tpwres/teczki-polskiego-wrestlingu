Project Basement was a series of taped shows produced by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), recorded in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government restrictions cancelled almost all public events in Poland, and the organization was unable to hold shows with a live audience.
Six episodes were recorded and released to YouTube, with the final two releasing on the same day.
