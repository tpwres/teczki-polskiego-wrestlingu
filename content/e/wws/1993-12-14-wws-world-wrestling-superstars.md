World Wrestling Superstars was a group of American wrestlers, doing a tour of Europe in 1993.
When Andrzej Supron learned about their shows, he contacted them, which led to the group making a single appearance in Poland.
The show was held in Torwar, a sports and music venue in Warsaw.

This was the only international wrestling event held in Poland before WWE arrived in the mid-2010s,
and aside from Supron's efforts in the 90s and early 2000s, the only professionally produced wrestling
until [DDW](@/o/ddw.md) and [TBW](@/o/tbw.md) held their first shows in 2009-2010.

The ["Prehistory of wrestling"](@/a/prehistory.md) article covers this era in more detail.
