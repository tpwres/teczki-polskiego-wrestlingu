MZW Green Madness was a show by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), held in [Bakara Community Centre](@/v/bakara.md).
The show was announced along with the poster depicting [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) and [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) - each of them having something to do with the titular "green".

## Build-up

* On 13.05.2025 MZW [announced][walizka] an eight-man tournament to be held at the show. The winners of each individual fight are going to take part in the main event (whose stipulation will be given at a later date), with the main prize being a contract briefcase. The contract will allow the tournament winner to challenge the current [MZW Champion](@/c/mzw-championship.md) _or_ the [PpW Champions](@/c/ppw-championship.md) - a first on the Polish wrestling scene. The contract can be used at any moment.
* Over the next weeks, MZW continued to reveal the matches at their Facebook.
* The first tournament match, revealed on 17.05.2025, was [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) vs [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md).

* On 3.06.2025 MZW announced a non-tournament match between [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Erik Šlotíř](@/w/erik-slotir.md). It marks Šlotíř's MZW debut.

### Recap

* Present in the audience was [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md).
* [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) delivered a long-winded promo dissing [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and the city of Wrocław. When the bell rang, Shadow went straight for a roll-up followed by an immediate three-count, ending the match in just a few seconds.
* [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) came out wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with a large red letter R - a clear reference to [Team Rocket][kiepoty] from the Pokémon series, of which [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) is a fan.
* When [Sędzia Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) wasn't looking, [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) came into the ring and loudly smashed a chair against the canvas, while Aron Wake fell down a few paces away, pretending to be hurt. This led the referee to disqualify Dziedzic on the grounds of collaborating with Mr Z to gain an unfair advantage over Wake.
* Referee Seweryn carried the unconscious Sambor backstage on his own back.
* During the main event, Aron Wake jumped from a ladder onto Mr Z and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) outside of the ring. However, despite being held by [Sędzia Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md), the ladder didn't remain stable during the execution of the move, causing Aron to fall onto the ring apron and break his arm.
* Despite the injury, Wake returned to the ring and proceeded to climb the ladder to get the briefcase. He was, however, stopped by Dziedzic, who pulled him back down and tied his legs to a ring post apparently stealing the victory from him, and allowing him to receive medical attention without breaking kayfabe.
* The day after the show, MZW officially [confirmed][arona-polamalo] Aron Wake's injury, stating that he was taken to a hospital.
