MZW Green Madness is an upcoming show by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), set to return to the [Bakara Community Centre](@/v/bakara.md).
The show was announced along with the poster depicting [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) and [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) - each of them having something to do with the titular "green".

## Build-up

The contract will allow the tournament winner to challenge the current [MZW Champion](@/c/mzw-championship.md) _or_ the [PpW Champions](@/c/ppw-championship.md) - a first on the Polish wrestling scene.
