MZW Green Madness is an upcoming show by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), set to return to the [Bakara Community Centre](@/v/bakara.md).
The show was announced along with the poster depicting [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) and [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) - each of them having something to do with the titular "green".

## Build-up

* On 13.05.2025 MZW [announced][walizka] an eight-man tournament to be held at the show. The winners of each individual fight are going to take part in the main event (whose stipulation will be given at a later date), with the main prize being a contract briefcase. The contract will allow the tournament winner to challenge the current [MZW Champion](@/c/mzw-championship.md) _or_ the [PpW Champions](@/c/ppw-championship.md) - a first on the Polish wrestling scene. The contract can be used at any moment.
* Over the next weeks, MZW continued to reveal the matches at their Facebook.
* The first tournament match, revealed on 17.05.2025, was [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) vs [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md).
