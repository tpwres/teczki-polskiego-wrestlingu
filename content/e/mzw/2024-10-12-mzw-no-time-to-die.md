After a nearly year-long hiatus following their [last event](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md), on August 1, 2024, [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) announced a new show, called No Time to Die.
The show is set to take place in [Bakara](@/v/bakara.md) Community Centre, which last held [MZW Project 7](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md) in 2020, and several other events before.

Like the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md), this one is also a collaboration with [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), seeing the return of [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), and the MZW debut of [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) and [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md); initially [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) was booked as well, but couldn't make it and instead [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), who'd previously wrestled for MZW as Kruger, filled in. It is also the first MZW show to feature ex-PTW wrestlers [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Samson](@/w/samson.md), [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md).

#### Build-up
* At the [last MZW show](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md) [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) defeated Michael Payne, becoming #1 contender for the vacated [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). His opponent was announced to be [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), last seen in MZW at [Project 8](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md), where he lost the championship match to [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md).
* [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), who made his MZW debut at [Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md) was announced to defent his [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) against a [former PTW wrestler](@/a/ptw-exits.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md).
* [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) vs [Alex Ace](@/w/alex-ace.md) was initially supposed to be a regular Singles Match, but two days before the show MZW [posted a message][ace-belt] stating that Alex Ace decided he was going to defend his ERW East Division Championship. That made this fight the third title match of the night, which in turn means that his is the first event in the history of Polish pro wrestling where three belts of three different and distinctly separate promotions are defended on one night (earlier in 2024 [PTW#5](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) featured three matches for different titles, but PTW:WWA has strong ties to PTW).
