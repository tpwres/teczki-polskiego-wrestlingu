No Time to Die was held in [Bakara](@/v/bakara.md) Community Centre on Saturday October 12th, 2024. This was a return to the venue, which last saw [MZW Project 7](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md) in 2020, and several other events before.

<!-- more -->

It was the only [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) show in 2024, after a nearly year-long hiatus following [Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md), and was announced on August 1, 2024.

Like the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md), this one is also a collaboration with [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), seeing the return of [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), and the MZW debuts of [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) and [Bill Feager](@/w/feager.md); initially [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) was booked as well, but couldn't make it and instead [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md), who'd previously wrestled for MZW as Kruger, filled in.
It is also the first MZW show to feature ex-PTW wrestlers [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Samson](@/w/samson.md), [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) and [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md).

### Build-up

* At the [last MZW show](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md) [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) defeated Michael Payne, becoming #1 contender for the vacated [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). His opponent was announced to be [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), last seen in MZW at [Project 8](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) in 2021, where he lost the championship match to [Rafael Kid](@/w/rafael-kid.md).
* [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), who made his MZW debut at [Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md) was announced to defend his [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) against a [former PTW wrestler](@/a/ptw-exits.md), [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md).
* [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) vs [Alex Ace](@/w/alex-ace.md) was initially supposed to be a regular Singles Match, but two days before the show MZW [posted a message][ace-belt] stating that Alex Ace decided he was going to defend his ERW East Division Championship. That made this fight the third title match of the night, which in turn means that his is the first event in the history of Polish pro wrestling where three belts of three different and distinctly separate promotions are defended on one night (earlier in 2024 [PTW#5](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) featured three matches for different titles, but PTW:WWA has strong ties to PTW).
* [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Sewi the Referee](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) made their MZW return, being three of [The Greens](@/a/the-greens.md) who have returned to MZW after a three-year-long hiatus.

### Outcomes and aftermath

* Adi came out clasping hands with the audience, earning him "Pan Pawłowski" chants in reference to the way [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) makes his entrance. Once in the ring, Adi was urged by the audience to drop to his knees - again, in the manner of Pawłowski - which he did.
* Before the show started [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) came out to the ring and announced his retirement from the in-ring competition, although he didn't specify a reason. Instead, he served as a referee for about half of the matches.
* Present in the audience was [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), who had a few minor fan interactions with the wrestlers.
* The Triple Threat Match started with [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) holding steel chairs, but [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) with a wooden one.
* Later in the match, Dziedzic grabbed the chair from Biesiad and exclaimed "I took away his only weapon!" Then Biesiad threw Marcelito at him.
* Samson's music was mistakenly played for a few seconds before [Sambor's](@/w/sambor.md) entrance.
* The Battle Royal wasn't on the card prior to the show; it was only announced moments before it happened.
* The event saw a surprise, unannounced return of [Polish Hammer](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), last seen in MZW's ring back in [2019](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md).
* Another unexpected return to wrestling was Tony Sheen, active many years ago on the backyard scene, in places like [PXW](@/o/pxw.md) and [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md), and as referee on the previous two MZW events.
* Johnny Blade and Feager put on a typical PpW style match, with weapons like kendo sticks, steel plates, chairs, road signs and an improvised mace.
* Both members of Legia Łysych had a singles match, and accompanied their partner to the ring. The local crowd reacted strongly to them, singing very crude [football stadium chants](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#wrestler-specific) against Legia.
* Prompted by the [popular chant](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md) of "Eat his head!" (_Zjedz mu łeb!_), [Samson](@/w/samson.md) bit [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) on the head.
* [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md) entered with a modified version of his theme song, adding an intro from Madonna's "Like a prayer", referencing his MZW past and prodigal son return. During the match, he played up his career-threatening injury (shattered collarbone) to garner heel heat in his match. After dodging Buckna's corner offense, he 'botched' a roll, leading to referee checking on him. He used this chance to low-blow [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) standing behind him, and make a come back for a near-fall.
* After the main event, Buckna addressed the crowd in German. He reminisced about first stepping in MZW's ring [eight years ago](@/e/mzw/2016-11-05-mzw-revolution.md), and his route to becoming the champion and face of the organization today. He also promised that his reign is that of a fighting champion, and he's ready to defend the belt anywhere, anytime. Finally, he offered a title match to Shadow, at a time and place of his choosing.
