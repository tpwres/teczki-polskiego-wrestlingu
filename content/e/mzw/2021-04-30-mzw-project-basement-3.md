Project Basement 3 is the third episode of [MZW's](@/o/mzw.md) taped wrestling shows. The episodes were produced and released during 2021, when COVID-19 pandemic restrictions canceled almost all public events in Poland. Unable to hold shows with audience, MZW instead recorded them and released on YouTube for free.
