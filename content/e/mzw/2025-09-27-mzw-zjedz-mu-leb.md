MZW Zjedz Mu Łeb (_Eat His Head_) was a show by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), held in [Bakara Community Centre](@/v/bakara.md). The name of the show is a reference to a [popular chant](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#calls-to-action).

## Build-up

* On 13.08.2025, MZW announced the first match - [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) vs [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md).
* On 18.08.2025 two matches were announced, splitting [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md): [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) vs [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) vs [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md).
* On 22.08.2025 MZW published a [promo][promo-dziedzic] by [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), in which he challenged [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) for a match at the upcoming show. In the video, Dziedzic stated that he's been hungry for success ever since he [escaped the cage](@/a/ptw-exits.md).
* On 27.08.2025 Mister Z issued a [reply][promo-z] refusing the challenge, on the grounds of him being on high enough level that he should only come to MZW to fight in title matches.

* On 17.09.2025 MZW released a [video][promo-matt] in which [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) called [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) a nobody for winning the Ladder Match at the [last show](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md) by playing dirty. He then addressed [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), whom he applauded for his perseverance and self-improvement, and in his appreciation of these traits he offered Dziedzic a match for his [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). The match was officially confirmed two days later.
* On 24.09.2025 MZW published a [video][riverman-challenge] by [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md), in which he issued an open challenge. The next day it was officially confirmed.

### Highlights

* [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md) came out and cut a promo, repeating his challenge. [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) then came out and Riverman challenged him to a fight for Matt's [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). The Champion denied, saying that Sheen would face a newcomer to the Polish scene, Felix Schweizer, instead.
* [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) had a large dressing on the back of his head, where he was injured in a table spot at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md) a week prior.
* A fan in the audience had [Ricardo Diesel's](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md) scarf saying [Bóg jest łysy](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#Wrestler-specific).
* [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) cut a promo, saying he's used to [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) fights always being no-DQ matches and that having to fight in regular stipulations feels off to him. [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) replied that a good wrestler can do well regardless of stipulation, but he agreed to a no-DQ fight.
* As Oskar grabbed a kendo stick from under the ring, Pablo looked for a weapon himself and found a short metal rod, which he then pointed at Alexander like a wand, Harry Potter-style. Although he failed to hex his opponent, he did succeed in entertaining the audience.
* Later in the match Pablo took a plastic bucket and put on over Oskar's head, drumming on it with his hands to confuse the younger contender. 
* Pablo found a garbage bag full of squashed beer cans, which he spilled over the ring and threw Oskar onto, winning the match.
