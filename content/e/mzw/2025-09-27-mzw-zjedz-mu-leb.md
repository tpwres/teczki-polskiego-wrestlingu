MZW Zjedz Mu Łeb (_Eat His Head_) was a show by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), held in [Bakara Community Centre](@/v/bakara.md). The name of the show is a reference to a [popular chant](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#calls-to-action).

## Build-up

* On 13.08.2025, MZW announced the first match - [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) vs [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md).
* On 18.08.2025 two matches were announced, splitting [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md): [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) vs [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) vs [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md).
* On 22.08.2025 MZW published a [promo][promo-dziedzic] by [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), in which he challenged [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) for a match at the upcoming show. In the video, Dziedzic stated that he's been hungry for success ever since he [escaped the cage](@/a/ptw-exits.md).
* On 27.08.2025 Mister Z issued a [reply][promo-z] refusing the challenge, on the grounds of him being on high enough level that he should only come to MZW to fight in title matches.
* On 7.09.2025 MZW announced a Triple Threat Match between [Febus 'The Wolf'](@/w/apollo-anderson.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) and [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md). This is Max's debut in MZW.
* On 17.09.2025 MZW released a [video][promo-matt] in which [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) called [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) a nobody for winning the Ladder Match at the [last show](@/e/mzw/2025-06-28-mzw-green-madness.md) by playing dirty. He then addressed [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), whom he applauded for his perseverance and self-improvement, and in his appreciation of these traits he offered Dziedzic a match for his [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). The match was officially confirmed two days later.
* On 24.09.2025 MZW published a [video][riverman-challenge] by [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md), in which he issued an open challenge. The next day it was officially confirmed.

### Highlights

* Present in the audience were [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md) and [Agentka Agatka](@/w/agentka-agatka.md).
* Whenever [Adrian Zgórski](@/w/adrian-zgorski.md) gave the wrestlers' weight while announcing them, the crowd would shout ["Mało!"](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#intros). He soon started to encourage people by raising his microphone.
* [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md) came out and cut a promo, repeating his challenge. [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) then came out and Riverman challenged him to a fight for Matt's [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). The Champion denied, saying that Sheen would face a newcomer to the Polish scene, Felix Schweizer, instead.
* Felix Schweizer, unknown to the Polish audience, came out to a somewhat lukewarm reception. Over the course of the match, however, he pretty quickly gained the crowd's approval.
* [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) had a large dressing on the back of his head, where he was injured in a table spot at [Mistrzowskie Rozdanie 2](@/e/ppw/2025-09-20-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie-2.md) a week prior.
* A fan in the audience had [Ricardo Diesel's](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md) scarf saying [Bóg jest łysy](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#wrestler-specific).
* After [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) lost to [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md), Olgierd attacked the winner and was soon joined by Marco in applying the beatdown. [Adrian Zgórski](@/w/adrian-zgorski.md) tried to stop them, only to be head-butted by Olgierd. [Legia Łysych](@/tt/legia-lysych.md) then proceeded to kick him whil he was down, but [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) quickly ran into the ring and chased the bald hooligans off.
* [Oskar Alexander](@/w/oskar-alexander.md) cut a promo, saying he's used to [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) fights always being no-DQ matches and that having to fight in regular stipulations feels off to him. [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) replied that a good wrestler can do well regardless of stipulation, but he agreed to a no-DQ fight.
* As Oskar grabbed a kendo stick from under the ring, Pablo looked for a weapon himself and found a short metal rod, which he then pointed at Alexander like a wand, Harry Potter-style. Although he failed to hex his opponent, he did succeed in entertaining the audience.
* Later in the match Pablo took a plastic bucket and put on over Oskar's head, drumming on it with his hands to confuse the younger contender. 
* Pablo found a garbage bag full of crushed beer cans, which he spilled over the ring and threw Oskar onto, winning the match.
* Adrian Zgórski refused to introduce [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) before his match. Marco did the honours instead.
* After defeating [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), Olgierd and Marco once again proceeded to kick the downed opponent. Like before, this was met with a fellow babyface coming to the rescue - this time Shadow ran out of the backstage and attacked Hammers. Meanwhile, Olgierd went after Adrian Zgórski, who tried to defend himself with a kendo stick, but Olgierd was unimpressed. Shadow then snuck up behind the bald hooligan and whacked him on the back with Disco Pablo's "wand", leaving him open for a hit with Adrian's kendo stick.
* With Olgierd disposed of, Shadow entered the ring and, together with Marcelito, ate Marco's head. Next the two high-flyers climbed the turnbuckles and delivered two top-rope moves: a Frog Splash by Marcelito, followed by Shadow's Moonsault.
* [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) came out in a shirt with the words "Dziedzic wstawaj... wygrałeś" (_Dziedzic, get up... you've won_) and a silhouette of his person lying unconscious in the ring. This was a reference to [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where [Pan Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) said "Syriusz, obudź się, wygrałeś" (_Syriusz, wake up, you've won_) to Dziedzic after he was brutally beaten by [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md) and [Santino](@/w/santino.md) following his victory.
* The main event was silently observed by a brooding [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), sitting in a wheelchair with his left arm in a cast.
* Dziedzic avoided a Spear from [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md), which hit [Sędzia Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) instead who, half-conscious, tumbled out of the ring.
* Soon after, Dziedzic pinned Matt, with nobody to count the pin. [Sędzia Kornel](@/w/sedzia-kornel.md) then ran into the ring and started counting, but Buckna put his leg on the bottom rope, breaking the count.
* Moments later, Matt Buckna executed another Spear, this time hitting Dziedzic as intended and winning the match.
* As Matt celebrated his victory, Aron Wake "miraculously" rose from the wheelchair, entered the ring, removed the cast from his arm and clobbered Buckna with it. He then grabbed the [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md) and promptly returned to his seat.
* Felix Schweizer then came out of the backstage, snatched the title from Wake's hands and returned it to its rightful ower, while the angered Aron was helplessly flailing about in the wheelchair, kept from running Felix over by a bodyboard.
