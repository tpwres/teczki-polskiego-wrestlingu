MZW Project 8 was announced on 29.02.2020, set to take place on 25.04.2020. A few matches were announced in the following days, but on 7.04.2020 the COVID-19 restrictions forced MZW to postpone the event indefinitely. The [Project Basement](@/e/project-basement.md) web series ran from March to July 2021 to keep the fans engaged during lockdown, and on 4.07.2021 Project 8 was announced again.

### Highlights

* [Konrad von Koch](@/w/konrad-von-koch.md), who hosted the Project Basement series, intervened in the tournament. He ejected [Madman Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) from the second match and replaced him with Aron Wake, the winner of Project Basement. As a result, the planned Four Way Match (Wake vs Krueger vs Isnorr vs Black) became a Three Way Match.
