MZW Forever is an upcoming show by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md), set to return to [Bakara Community Centre](@/v/bakara.md) on Saturday, 29th of March 2025.

### Build-up
* Along with show's announcement, the poster featuring [MZW Champion](@/c/mzw-championship.md) [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md) was posted - confirming his appearance.
* The first competitor to be officially announced was [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md), mostly appearing for [PpW](@/o/ppw.md). With MZW's notably thin roster, this set the tone for yet another cross-over MZW show.
