This was a short event held by MZW in [Głuchołazy](@/v/gosir-glucholazy.md). It was the third annual charity show, with donations going to [WOŚP][wosp], and coinciding with their 25th annual Grand Finale event.

Originally [Prince Victor](@/w/vic-golden.md) was scheduled to team up with [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and [Szymon Siwiec](@/w/szymon-siwiec.md). Before the main event, Lider interrupted the announcer, and issued a challenge to the locker room. This resulted in a heated conversation with one of MZW rookies, soon joined by another one, which led to the match.

Attendance: estimated about 300
