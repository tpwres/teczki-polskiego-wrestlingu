MZW I Kosmiczny Wrestling Show (_1st Cosmic Wrestling Show_) was a non-canon event produced by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) during their short-lived excursion to Toruń. It took place on the 18th of December 2021 in {{ map_pin(v="2 LO Toruń") }}2 LO. The show was created in cooperation with a charity foundation "Kosmiczna Droga Do Gwiazd im. Damiana Laskowskiego" (_Damian Laskowski's Cosmic Road to the Stars_), which focuses on helping people with disabilities. According to [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), one of MZW's co-owners at the time, the project was supposed to start a new family-friendly charity federation, but due to COVID-19 restrictions, the plan was abandoned for the foreseeable future.

It is known that performers to appear at the show included [Deti Black](@/w/dieter-schwartz.md), [Chris X](@/w/chris-x.md), Nick Schreier, Rogers, Lio Zayde, [Zeritus](@/w/zeritus.md), [Matt Buckna](@/w/matt-buckna.md), [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) and Jędruś Bułecka. The show was streamed live on the Foundation's Facebook page.
