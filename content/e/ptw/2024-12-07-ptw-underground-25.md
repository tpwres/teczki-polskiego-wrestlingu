PTW Underground 25 is an upcoming event by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). The event's name refers to the date, close to December 6th, when Poland celebrates [Saint Nicholas Day][st-nicholas-day], and is when the Christmas season kicks into gear. This makes its similar to [PTW Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md) which was also Christmas-themed.

For this event, PTW invited Session Moth Martina, Irish wrestler from Dublin, who's very active on the British and Irish scenes since 2017, primarily in Pro-Wrestling EVE and Over The Top Wrestling.
