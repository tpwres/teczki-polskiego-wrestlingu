PTW Underground 25 was an event by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). The event's name refers to the date, close to December 6th, when Poland celebrates [Saint Nicholas Day][st-nicholas-day] (Mikołajki), and is when the Christmas season kicks into gear. This makes its similar to [PTW Underground 19](@/e/ptw/2023-12-09-ptw-underground-19.md) which was also Christmas-themed.

For this event, PTW invited several debuting wrestlers:

* Session Moth Martina, Irish wrestler from Dublin, who's very active on the British and Irish scenes since 2017, primarily in Pro-Wrestling EVE and Over The Top Wrestling.
* Italian-born, Dublin-based Bittersweet Josh, also appearing for Over The Top.
* Italian wrestler Flamingo, from Brescia.

### Build up

* On 21.11.2024 PTW announced that Irish pro wrestler Session Moth Martina will make her debut in Prime Time Wrestling.
* On 25.11.2024 it was also announced that from this Underground onwards PTW will take sponsorship deal from geek-store.

#### Storylines overview

* After his victory over Arron Williams at [the previous underground](@/e/ptw/2024-11-16-ptw-underground-24.md) [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) was set to take on Puncher in the main event of this show for [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). Spartan as babyface gained a lot of support from both fans and some of personalities in PTW, especially after Puncher viciously attacked Prezes Okoński at the end of Underground 24.
* [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) continued his feud with [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) which can be traced since [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md). Alex declared that he will end Miyagi's career in PTW, so the martial artist agreed that if he lose, he will retire from Prime Time Wrestling.
* Shortly before Pawłowski made an appearance on Marcin Najman's "Oryginalne Zero" YouTube channel in a video titled "The Whole Truth About Polish Wrestling", which prompted further controversy on the Polish scene. Asked if he's the only wrestling promoter in Poland, Pawłowski claimed that he is the only professional one, acknowledging the competition but calling them "more or less amateur projects".

### Recap

Timestamps refer to the Istota Wrestlingu YouTube videos linked in the [References](#references) section, and mark the start of wrestler entrances, not the opening bell.

{% timeline() %}

#### Opening

* Timestamp: `0:00:01`
* [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) makes his classic entrance. This time he is wearing Santa Claus's hoodie.
* He greets the fans. Crowd is chanting his name as he is hyping up the card and sponsors.
* Pawłowski makes few announcements: This Underground would be the last of its cycle, as from January onwards PTW will drop "Underground" to produce "bigger" shows. However, to honour this classic cycle, in 3-4 months PTW will introduce PTW Underground Championship - most propably a midcard championship.
* After these announcements Pawłowski also states that after attack on Prezes Okoński at last Underground Puncher was financially fined by Pawłowski.
* When Pawłowski is trying to announce the first fight Puncher's theme is heard. PTW Champion enters the ring and attacks Pawłowski verbally stating that Arek can't control him. He "shoots" on both Pawłowski and Okoński, making references to Pawłowski's statement from "Oryginalne Zero" saying that [all of his talent left him](@/a/ptw-exits.md) and he ain't no pro wrestling messiah. He also shoots at late [Bad Bones](@/w/bad-bones.md) saying, that he died just to get away from Arkadiusz.
* Pawłowski - while almost crying - states that he made a lot of mistakes, but the biggest one is making Puncher a face of PTW, he also calls his champion "an ungrateful son of a bitch". PTW's owner states that today is the day of Puncher's defeat, when [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) will take [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) from him.

#### Erik Slotir vs Max Speed

* Timestamp: `0:11:00`
* [Erik Slotir](@/w/erik-slotir.md) makes his way to the ring first trying to mock [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md). Crowd is chanting "krecik!" (reference to popular czechoslovakian animated series) which visibly upsets Erik.
* Erik cuts short promo, basically saying that he is way better than his opponent and the Christmas is cancelled.
* Max Speed enters the ring as the second one, wearing Santa's hat and Christmas sweater.
* Meanwhile Referee Herno is entering the ring.
* Match goes for about 8 minutes with standard back-and-forth structure, with Erik trying to overpower Max mainly on the ringside.
* At the end of the match Erik tries to hit top-rope manouver, but Speed ducks and hits his opponent with Superkick and Codebreaker to secure victory over czech wrestler.
* Winner: Max Speed by pinfall

#### Triple Threat International Showcase Match: Flamingo vs Pedro vs Blaze

* Timestamp: `0:26:04`
* Pawłowski announces the next match who wasn't on the card before. It is a Triple Threat International Showcase Match.
* [Referee Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) enters the ring.
* First one to enter the ring is Flamingo - italian wrestler.
* The second one is Pedro - also an italian wrestler.
* The third contender is Blaze, who made couple of PTW's apperances previously.
* Match goes for about 7 minutes with simple structure of triple threat match. Flamingo and Pedro are portrayed as mostly heel-leaning characters working together against Blaze due to fact, that they are both italian-born. Finally Blaze overcomes them after hitting his finishing move on Flamingo.
* Winner: Blaze by pinfall

#### Career Threating Match: Alex Brave vs Miyagi Shida 

* Timestamp: `38:35`

* [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) makes his way to the ring as the second one.
* Match starts with multiple flash pinfall attempts from Alex. He is punished by Shida and quickly retreats to ringside.
* After that Alex dominates the match for most part with Shida doing only few fightbacks before finally being able to hit a comeback and Superkick Alex, who takes his time to taunt over to the public instead focusing on his opponent in the crucial part of the match.
* Winner: Miyagi Shida by pinfall
* Shida celebrates by standing and bowing on a chair, which was reserved for him by Alex Brave.

#### Vincent Caravaggio vs Newt Nova

* Timestamp: `0:51:47`
* [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) makes his heelish entrance first.
* He also cuts promo roasting the public for being less-inteligent and running from reality into the world of fantasy - taking a shot on the new sponsor.
* Pawłowski takes the opportunity to mention the sponsor's name.
* Newt Nova makes his way to the ring.
* The whole match is spent on Vincent aiming mostly for Nova leg to prohibbit him from making any of his signature actions from top rope. The match finally ends after Vincent wears down Newt Nova's leg enough to put him in Ankle Lock to finish off the fight via submission.
* Winner: Vincent Caravaggio by submission

#### Hardcore Tornado Tag Team Match: Budapest Bastards (Renegade & Nitro) vs L'Orda Luca Bjorn & Rust - PTW Tag Team Championship

* Timestamp: `1:08:00`
* L'Orda members - [Luca Bjorn](@/w/luca-bjorn.md) and [Rust](@/w/rust.md) makes their way to the ring first.
* Budapest Bastards - [Nitro](@/w/nitro.md) and [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md) are the second one to enter, as they are [PTW Tag Team Champions](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md)
* Match is officiated by Sędzia Klaudiusz, with Sędzia Herno standing at the ringside as a backup referee.
* Whole fight is filled with intense action due to sheer nature of the stipulation. For the most part the weapons aren't used much, with most of the damage being done during ringside brawls. Later on items such as kendo stick, plasma TV and table are used.
* When Renegade hits one of his opponents with Crucifix Powerbomb onto a table he tries to secure a pinfall, he is however stopped by another member of L'Orda making a save with Championship Belt strike onto back of Renegade's head and secures a pinfall.

* [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) is the second one to enter the ring.
* Match lasts for about 11 minutes with classic face vs heel action.
* Both wrestlers are going back-and-forth before Nano is visibly trying to put his opponent in Sharpshooter. Josh is however able to free himself from this attempt to defeat Nano with a rollup.

#### Diana Strong vs Session Moth Martina

* Timestamp: `0:20:17`
* Session Moth Martina is entering the ring first. She is drinking beer and gains a lot of pop from the crowd for her character and theme song.
* [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) makes her way to the ring as the second one.
* Martina is visibly dominating her opponent for most of the match with Diana making few strong comebacks and big moves on her, but still not being able to regain full control over slick opponent.
* Finally Diana is able to hit strong counter after absorbing Headbutt from SMM. She hits her opponent with strong Knee Strike and proceeds to hit her finishing move.
* Winner: Diana Strong by pinfall
* Ending of a match was recepted kind of underwhelming as Referee Herno makes rather indecisive three-count and Diana's theme plays way too late, as if it was botched finish.

#### Serg Sullivan vs  El Homo (Prezes Okoński)

* Timestamp: `0:35:56`
* Serg Sullivan makes his way to the ring as the first one.
* Pawłowski announces his opponent - the debuting El Homo - which is a reference to one of the gimmicks used by ex-KPW wrestlers [Ostrowski](@/w/ostrowski.md). It is however a brand new character.
* New character is making way to the ring. He is being held on a chain by a young woman dressed only in black trench coat and lingerie, and his black mask is resembling one used in BDSM.
* Due to El Homo golden attire the crowd is chanting "Vic!" - making a reference to ex-PTW wrestler [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)
* Match is rather basic witch Serg overpowering his opponent for good part of it.
* Finally, close to the finish of the match El Homo is being unmasked by Sullivan - it is revealed that the masked person was Prezes Łukasz Okoński.
* After unmasking Prezes Okoński gets the second wind and makes strong comeback, but he is still defeated by Serg Sullvian
* Winner: Serg Sullivan by pinfall

#### Segment: Łukasz Okoński post-match interview

* Timestamp: `0:46:50`

* Okoński basically thanks everyone for support on his way to his debut match.

#### Puncher (c) vs Spartan - PTW Championship

* Timestamp: `51:55`
* [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) makes his way to the ring as the first one, rocking his new AI-generated theme song.
* Self-proclaimed moral compass of polish wrestling makes his way to the ring as the second one.
* Whole match appears to be even-leveled bout of two strong competitors.

* Spartan hits Puncher with _Spartan Bomb_, but there is no one alive to count his pinfall attempt on Puncher. After unsuccesfull attempt of waking up Klaudiusz he approaches downed Puncher, but he manages to hit him with low blow.
* Pawłowski enters the ring holding a chair. It appears that he will strike down Puncher to ensure Spartan's win, but at the last second he strikes Spartan with it, which allows Puncher to secure a pinfall.
* Winner: Puncher (c) by pinfall

#### Ending

* Timestamp: `0:03:13`
