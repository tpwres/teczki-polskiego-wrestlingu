"Piknik Charytatywny Fundacji Nadzieja Dzieci" (_Charity Picnic of the Children's Hope Foundation_) was a charity showcase by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), serving as an encore to [PTW: Dzień Dziecka](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md) from the previous day. As the local charity foundation holds numerous events at [Szafirowy Dwór](@/v/dworek-kozlow.md), PTW sometimes chooses to accompany the festivities. For this show, only the (incomplete) list of results was given by PTW in the comment section underneath the results of the main Dzień Dziecka show. Therefore, the details are scarce - an incomplete list of battle royal entrants, and no credits for referees or the ring announcer.

## Build-up

* On 31.05.2025, right before the closing segment of PTW: Dzień Dziecka, Pawłowski announced an additional, non-televised show during Children's Day festivities in the area on the following day.
* Besides the announcement, there were no details given.

The battle royal included "kilkanaście" (a range above 10 or 11, but below 20) competitors, both PTW wrestlers and rookies.
* Pulling a double duty, Max Speed defeated Ben Rodgers in what was an "incredibly fast-paced match" as per the report, to retain the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md).
* There was a post-show meet'n'greet with an opportunity to enter the ring.
