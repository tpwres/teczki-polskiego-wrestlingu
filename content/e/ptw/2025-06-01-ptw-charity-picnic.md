"Piknik Charytatywny Fundacji Nadzieja Dzieci" (_Charity Picnic of the Children's Hope Foundation_) was a charity showcase by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), serving as an encore to [PTW: Dzień Dziecka](content/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md) show from previous day. As the local charity foundation holds numerous events at Szafirowy Dwór, PTW sometimes chooses to accompany the festivities. For this show, the only (incomplete) list of results was given by PTW in comment section to the results of main Children's Day show. Therefore, the details are scarce - incomplete list of battle royal entrants, no credits for referees and ring announcer.

## Build-up

* On 31.05, at PTW: Dzień Dziecka, right before the closing segment, Pawłowski announced an additional, non-televised show during Children's Day festivities in the area the following day.
* Beside the announcement, there were no details given.
