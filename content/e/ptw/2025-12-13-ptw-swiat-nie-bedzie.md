## Recap

* Nano Lopez retained his championship after distracting referee, illegally poking Klakson's eyes and hitting him with his Last Plane To Spain.
* After Nano's match he cut a short promo and got attacked by masked character. After hitting Last Plane To Spain on Nano himself, it was revealed that it's Daniel Razor, who cut his hair and wants to reclaim Underground Championship back from "Starboy". Pan Pawłowski intervenes, and reschedules Razor's hardcore match from later in a card to this moment.
* Daniel Razor won his Christmas Hardcore Match after hitting his finishing move "Razor's Blade" on crushed Christmas baubles.
* Łukasz Okoński comes to the ring with MiyagiSigma (team of Miyagi Shida and Sigma Boy XD), and grants them an opportunity to become #1 Contenders for [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). Pawłowski interrupts, and declares that he is still a co-owner of PTW, so he can decide who is going to be Miyagi & Sigma opponents. He chooses two of [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) adepts - Bumper and Dropper. The team gets announced as "Drop and Bump". He also introduced a third team consisting of debuting Bart Petro and Hungarian wrestler [Blaze](@/w/blaze.md).
* Triple Threat Tag Team Match has been won by MiyagiSigma. They celebrated by helping themselves with "Wojanek" - a non-alcoholic beverage popular with Polish representatives of Gen-Alpha.
* Damian Lambert won his match against fellow ex-[KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestler Sawicki by submission.
* After intermission an artistic performance was presented by Domix - Polish beatboxer. Łukasz Okoński also hosted a charity t-shirt auction.
* [Remo](@/w/remo.md) - one of PTW Originals who's career has been halted by numerous injuries makes his official return to PTW after teasing it on social media. He cuts a promo where he shows his grudge against PTW fans, who all forgot about him while he was out injured. He woves to eliminate each of fan's favourites, starting with another "Usurpator from Bydgoszcz" - CJ Klakson.
* Before their Tag Team match [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md) comes to the ring with a neatly-packed giftbox adressed to PTW Fans. Alex Brave opened it to show literally nothing to public (a white sheet of paper with "NIC" (_NOTHING_) printed on it).
* Vincent secured a victory for Royal Rebels after puting Davide Adami in a STF - a signature move of John Cena - to secure a vin by submission.
* Polski Niedźwiedź finally managed to break his losing record after defeating Baron Wolfgang Storm. In a post-match promo he announced, that after new year, he will come back with a companion, possibly teasing an debut of new Tag Team partner or manager.
* Spartan makes special entrance with his "Spartan Army" - a group of loyal supporters and allies accompanying him to the ring.
* Much of the main event falls to shenanigans of Pan Pawłowski, who at some point grabs a microphone to distract Spartan. After [Referee Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) accidentaly gets knocked-out, [Referee Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md) is stopped from entering the ring by Pawłowski, who deemed Herno to be "too fat, slow, and biased", instead he calls out Sędzia Rafał - Alex Brave's old persona before his in-ring debut - who tries to sabotage Spartan's match. Shortly after furious Herno comes to the ring and throws S.Rafał out, regaining his position. Furious Pawłowski comes to the ring to berate on Herno once again, but he tells his boss to "shut his mouth" and orders him to exit the arena. The intimidation check ultimately fails, as Herno gets knocked out after a single slap from Pawłowski.
* Spartan meets another obstacle on his path, as Nano also intervenes by hitting him with a chair, but the stakes got even as Daniel Razor comes out to avenge Spartan and draw Nano away from title contender.
* Another pair of run-ins is Caravaggio, who is stopped by Sigma Boy XD right before he tries to put down Spartan.
* Desperate Pawłowski, who lost all his [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) assets, calls out adept Boguś - PTW's Timekeeper and rookie - to get his dream debut if only he will turn on Spartan and attack him. He enters the ring at first, but stops just before hitting Spartan with a Spear, just to attack Puncher with the same move, proving, that he won't turn on Spartan.
* Pawłowski enters the ring by himself wielding a toy lightsaber. He is interrupted by Łukasz Okoński, who enters a ring with a lightsaber on its own. After a intense toy-lightsaber duel Master Okoński finally defeats his nemesis allowing Spartan to put Pawłowski down.
* The endgame is done as Spartan pins Puncher sucessfully and emerges victorious from this battle, becoming new [PTW Champion](@/c/ptw-championship.md).
