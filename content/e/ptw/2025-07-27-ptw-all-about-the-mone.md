"All About the Moné" is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

## Build-up

* The show was first announced at [PTW: Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md) in a heel promo by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). This raised doubt about the sincerity of the announcement, as the new show was supposed to take place only a week later and feature the AEW TBS Champion, Mercedes Moné. The Internet fans were called out for doubting Pawłowski in the next segment where he reiterated the announcement.
* Late night on 20.07.2025 Moné posted an Instagram story about the event, followed by PTW's official [Facebook post][mercedes-przyjedzie] confirming that Mercedes would have a match, as well as a meet-and-greet.
* The next day, as ticket sales commenced on Going, PTW announced that Moné would face [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md).
* As per the announcement on ticket platform Going, the show is set to include:
  * Mercedes Moné in action
  * an appearance by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) faction, [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md)
  * championship matches
  * and more
* After first pool of tickets sold out, PTW [confirmed](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=787985673554077&set=a.136592408693410) that the show tickets do not include the meet-and-greet, which will be a separate event.
* The poster for the show includes [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) and Moné side by side, suggesting their match might be for the GLAM! Championship, currently held by Diana.
* On 23.07.2025 PTW [announced][wiela-pasow-bydzie] that the stakes of Diana vs Mercedes will be "more than one championship belt", although no further details were given.
* On 24.07.2025, Italian partner federation Bestya Slam [confirmed][pas-wloski] that their new Women's Championship will be on the line
* On 25.07.2025 PTW announced a new tag team to compete for the [PTW Tag Team Championships](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md): Miyagi Sigma, consisting of [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) and [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md), taking on the current champions, [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md).
* On 26.07 2025 PTW [confirmed][meet-n-greet] the prices for the meet'n'greet with Mercedes Moné: $50 or 180&nbsp;PLN, paid on entry.
* Right before the show, Bestya Slam posted an [interview][pasy-ziemi-wloskiej-i-wolski] with Diana Strong on their social media, talking about the match with Moné. They mention the championships that are going to be contested, which are shown hanging on the ring ropes in the background: Bestya Women's Championship and [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md). This suggests that the tournament was heavily changed or even effectively scrapped - as Diana is the only one qualified to the finals and the other semi-final did not happen yet.
