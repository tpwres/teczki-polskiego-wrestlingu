"All About the Moné" was a show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), held on Sunday, July 27th 2025. The show is named after its main draw, former WWE wrestler [Mercedes Moné](@/w/mercedes-mone.md).

## Build-up

* The show was first announced at [PTW: Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md) in a heel promo by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). This raised doubt about the sincerity of the announcement, as the new show was supposed to take place only one week later and feature the AEW TBS Champion, [Mercedes Moné](@/w/mercedes-mone.md). Internet fans were called out for doubting Pawłowski in the next segment where he reiterated the announcement.
* Late night on 20.07.2025, Moné posted an Instagram story about the event, followed by PTW's official [Facebook post][mercedes-przyjedzie] confirming her involvement, in both a match and a meet-and-greet with the fans.
* The next day, as ticket sales commenced on Going, PTW announced that Moné would face [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md).
* As per the announcement on ticket platform Going, the show was set to include:
  * [Mercedes Moné](@/w/mercedes-mone.md) in action
  * an appearance by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) faction, [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md)
  * championship matches
  * and more
* After the first pool of tickets sold out, PTW [confirmed](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=787985673554077&set=a.136592408693410) that the tickets do not include the meet-and-greet, which will be a separate event.
* The poster for the show included [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) and Moné side by side, suggesting their match might be for the GLAM! Championship, currently held by Diana.
* On 23.07.2025 PTW [announced][wiela-pasow-bydzie] that the stakes of Diana vs Mercedes will be "more than one championship belt", although no further details were given.
* On 24.07.2025, Italian partner federation BestYa Slam [confirmed][pas-wloski] that their new Women's Championship will be on the line.
* On 25.07.2025 PTW announced a new tag team to compete for the [PTW Tag Team Championships](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md): Miyagi Sigma, consisting of [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) and [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md), taking on the current champions, [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md).
* On 26.07.2025 PTW [confirmed the prices][meet-n-greet] for the meet'n'greet with Mercedes Moné: $50 or 180&nbsp;PLN, paid on entry.
* Right before the show, BestYa Slam posted an [interview][pasy-ziemi-wloskiej-i-wolski] with Diana Strong on their social media, where she talked about the match with Moné.
  They mentioned the championships that are going to be contested, which are shown hanging on the ring ropes in the background: BestYa Women's Championship and [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md).
  This suggested that the tournament for the latter championship was heavily changed or even effectively scrapped - as Diana is the only one qualified to the finals, and the other semi-final did not happen yet.
