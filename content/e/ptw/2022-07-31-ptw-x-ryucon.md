PTW X Ryucon was held at the [Tauron Arena](@/v/tauron-arena.md), Kraków on July 31st, 2022. The Tauron Arena is a large venue, the wrestling show was hosted in a smaller side room in the conference section of the arena. The event was not streamed on any official channels.

This was the first time [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) appeared as part of a fan convention.
They partnered with Ryucon, one of the biggest Polish anime/manga conventions, which takes place annually in Kraków.
Earlier that same year, [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) made a similar appearance at Poland's biggest fan convention [Pyrkon](@/e/kpw/2022-06-18-kpw-pyrkon-2022.md).

For this event, PTW invited Belgian wrestler Mike D. Vecchio, a regular in many independent European organizations. His scheduled opponent was Krampus, but he failed to appear, and was replaced with Marcelito.

### Recap

* In a promo before his match, Puncher teased the audience by showing interest in a manga book. He then proceeded to tear it up and crush the pages, and derided the audience for enjoying it.
* For this event, unique entrance graphics were used, sometimes with character portraits done in a manga style. Samson altered his entrance routine - instead of entering in his signature military jacket, he wore a headband and a green "forest camo" poncho, with kendo stick in hand.
