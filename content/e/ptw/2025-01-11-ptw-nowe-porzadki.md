"Nowe Porządki" (_A New Order_) is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) and the second "minor" show to drop the "Underground" name. The show was announced around eight hours after [KPW Arena 27: Nowe Porządki](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md); whether or not the identical names are a coincidence, currently remains unknown.

The show's official poster clearly references [recent controversies](@/o/ptw.md#polish-wrestling-scene). "Odklejony Grubas" (_Loony Fat Man_), seen in the top right corner, is a direct quote from [Piękny Kawaler's](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) lengthy Facebook post responding to PTW owner [Arkadiusz Pawłowski's](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) statements about him and the Polish scene made in late 2024.
The newspaper column to the left of Pawłowski's head is that post quoted verbatim. Also, above his shoulder we see a truncated heading which reads "Mesjasz Polskiego Pro Wrestlingu" (_The Messiah of Polish Pro Wrestling_), which is what Pawłowski likes to call himself.

The official ticket sale commenced on [Going][going], the description there provided some insight to the card. Planned are: a tournament to crown the inaugural PTW Women's Champion, "Pawłowski's confession", [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) defense. Also to appear "in action" are: [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md), [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md)

On January 3rd 2025, PTW announced on their [Facebook][fb-puncher] that Puncher is going to defend his title against Max Speed.

On 7.01.2025 the promotion published a [Facebook post][fb-womens-tournament], announcing the first match in a tournament for the new [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md).
