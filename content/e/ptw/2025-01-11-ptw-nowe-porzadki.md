"Nowe Porządki" (_A New Order_) is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) and the first to drop the "Underground" name. The show was announced around eight hours after [KPW Arena 27: Nowe Porządki](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md); whether or not the identical names are a coincidence, currently remains unknown.
