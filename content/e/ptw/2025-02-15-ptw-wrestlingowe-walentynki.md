"Wrestlingowe Walentynki" (_Wrestling Valentine's Day_) was an event by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), that took place the day after St. Vallentine's Day. It is the third PTW show, after [Halloweenowy Łomot](@/e/ptw/2024-10-19-ptw-underground-23.md) and [Wrestlingowe Mikołajki](@/e/ptw/2024-12-07-ptw-underground-25.md), to be named after a holiday.

A tournament for the newly created [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) started at this show. It began with a round of four quarter-final matches followed by two semi-finals. Due to a (kayfabe) injury of one of the finalists, the finals were postponed until the next show, [Wiosenna Bijatyka](@/e/ptw/2025-03-15-ptw-wiosenna-bijatyka.md), with the added stipulation of a _Ladder Match_.

Team Turbulence, making their debut in the main PTW organization, are also the current PTW/WWA Tag Team Champions, but their titles were not at stake in the championship match.
The [Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) tournament saw two debuts: Hungarian wrestler and stuntman with nine years of experience, Ken Pyro, as well as graduate of [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md), Sigma Boy xD. The [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md) tournament continued with an unannounced match between Kiara and Betty Boa. It was never revealed, however, which round of the tournament this match was.

## Build-up

* On January 22th, [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) stated via her Instagram story that she was mistakenly featured on the show's poster as well as the poster for Bestya Rumble, a show in Italy with strong PTW involvement. Per Diana's words, she announced her unavailability in advance. As of 23.01, neither organization corrected their poster.
* The next matches in the [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md) tournament are set to take place - as per the event page on Facebook.
* On January 27th, PTW announced the debut of a new competitor - a rookie from [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md). The debutant is going to be in action in "one of key matches of the evening" (per the post).
* On January 28th, PTW announced that [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) will be in action. No mention if this is going to be a title defense of either the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) or the WWA Championship.
* On January 29th, PTW announced a [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) defense. After succesful title defense at the Bestya Rumble show on February 9th against Double Speed (a team of Spencer and Zoom), L'Orda's will defend the titles against Team Turbulence. This is a rematch from PTW/WWA Takeover in November where Team Turbulence retained WWA Tag Team Championship against L'Orda. Though Team Turbulence is coming into the match as WWA Tag Team Champions, this is not a unification match.
* On January 30th, PTW announced the first quarter-final match for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md), in which Max Speed is going to take on a debuting rookie - presumably the same one who was previously announced to debut.
* On February 7th, PTW released a full bracket for the tournament. The first semi-final will feature the winner of Max Speed vs ??? against the winner of Blaze vs Alex Brave. In the other semi-final, the winner of Ken Pyro vs Vincent Caravaggio will face off against the winner of Erik Šlotíř vs Spartan.
