#### Recap

* [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) was previously kidnapped and held captive by [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md). In this return, he became Sinister's ally, with a new look, theme song and a more aggressive moveset.
* In a post-match interview, [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) answered all questions on behalf of [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), without allowing him to speak. Sinister announced that the next [Underground show](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) is when Dziedzic's baptism is going to be held.
* [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) came alone, without the support of [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md).
* [Karol "Iskra" Górski](@/w/iskra.md) came out to challenge [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md) to a match on the next Underground show.
* After [Samson](@/w/samson.md)'s match, he was attacked by Sinister and his allies. [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) tried to make a save, but got beaten down as well. Lights went out, [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) entered with a steel chair and successfully makes a save.
* [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) came out to insult manga fans and culture, and tried burning manga books in a bucket full of gasoline. Some of the gasoline spilled out and burned the ring, a crewmember extinguished the fire.
* [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) interrupted Pan Pawłowski. He confirmed cutting ties with John "Bad Bones" Klinger, and proclaimed loyalty to Pawłowski. This storyline saw its conclusion months later at [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md).
* The tag team championship defense was a no-contest due to an intervention by Legia Łysych ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) & [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md)) with [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md). The champions retained. Both teams chased off the heels. Show ended with babyfaces standing tall.
