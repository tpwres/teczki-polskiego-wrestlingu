### Recap

* The show started with a new "PTW Anthem" by a little-known rapper Buntownik (_The Rebel_).
* In the opening promo by Nietykalni, Pawłowski rambled on about their achievements, berating Okoński and the referees. He announced an additional PTW show for the next Sunday (27.07), including an appearance by, and a meet'n'greet with, the AEW TBS Champion, [Mercedes Moné](@/w/mercedes-mone.md). The show's name was not revealed.
* Diana defeated Lucy Couture in a fairly short match, retaining her GLAM! Women's Championship.
* Spartan defeated Flex Skywalker in a short match.
* Sigma Boy xD defeated Andi ZickZack in a competitive, fast-paced match.
* Skwarczyński proceeded to announce a Fatal 5-Way International Showcase Match including four Italian competitors and one from Austria - not revealed before the show. It featured two debuting stars: Nic Wesker from Austria and Ricky Eagle from Italy (mistakenly announced as Rick Eagle). El G won, stealing a victory from Luca Bjorn once again.
* In an impromptu match-up, Puncher retained his PTW Championship against Flamingo.
* Okoński made his entrance for te usual charity auction of a commemorative T-shirt with signatures of PTW personnel. The winning bid was 500&nbsp;PLN. Okoński called out Caravaggio due to the result of the bet from the previous show - depending on the performance of Nietykalni or Okoński, either Caravaggio gets Okoński's logo tattooed, or Łukasz Okoński apologizes for insulting Caravaggio's late grandmother. Vincent proudly revealed that no tattoo was made. As punishment, Okoński brought out the returning Krampus as his opponent.
* After unsuccessful comebacks, Caravaggio got squashed by Krampus.
* Sullivan's real-life partner Lesya slowly transitioned to a managerial role. In his match against Polski Niedźwiedź, she made numerous referee distractions, allowing for the introduction of multiple foreign objects. The match ended when Niedźwiedź incapacitated himself with a cannonball outside the ring onto the railing. Sullivan brought him back to the ring, with a diving elbow drop for a win.
* Post-match, Sullivan injured Niedźwiedź's neck, trapping it in a chair and hitting it with another one. Miyagi Shida appeared and chased Sullivan off. Livid Pawłowski entered with a mic, saying he wanted to get rid of one of the performers before they destroy that show. To make it possible, he announced Shida vs Sullivan in a Casket Match for the next show.
* Alex Brave made an entrance with his still-unnamed valet. After a hard hitting match including multiple items, Okoński beat him using "The Brave Show" sign as weapon.
* Post-match, Okoński said Pawłowski was right - their feud is not a game and needs to be taken seriously. He vowed to be a leader that Pawłowski failed to be. He brought out Spartan and they made a deal to form an alliance against Pawłowski. Spartan shook his hand and teased adding more members to even the odds against the four of Nietykalni.
* Skwarczyński announced the introduction of multi-show passes.
* Up next, CJ Klakson, the "hottest free agent" who'd teased a PTW appearance over previous weeks, made his entrance. He cuts a promo declaring that despite the offers from all over the world, he'd decided to sign with PTW. He put over the PTW roster and declared his readiness to take on any and all challengers. As per commentary, 'CJ' stands for 'Kacper Jeremiasz' spelled in English and despite never making an official debut, he'd already trained in Germany and other places.
* Up next a match for the vacant PTW Underground Championship. After a competitive match, Razor beat Lopez with a sunset flip to become the new champion.
* PTW referees cut a promo airing their grievances against Pawłowski and teasing retirement. Pawłowski interrupted, blameing them for being Okoński's referees instead of PTW referees. To put Herno and Klaudiusz in line, he put them in a match against [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md).
