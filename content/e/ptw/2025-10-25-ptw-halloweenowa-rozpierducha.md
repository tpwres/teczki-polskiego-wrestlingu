"Halloweenowa Rozpierducha" (roughly _Halloween Havoc_, or _Halloween Eff-Up_) was a show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). The show was announced in a Facebook post alongside [Totalna Anihilacja](@/e/ptw/2025-11-15-ptw-totalna-anihilacja.md). It was the second Halloween-themed show, following 2024's [Underground 23](@/e/ptw/2024-10-19-ptw-underground-23.md).

## Build-up

* Over the previous months PTW was building towards the match between the teams led by the two Chairmen. While [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) already had his team of [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md), [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) was busy recruiting his men. After [Ból Istnienia](@/e/ptw/2025-09-28-ptw-bol-istnienia.md), Team Okoński was finally completed with the addition of [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) and [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md). Thus, a 4 on 4 match was confirmed for the next show.
* On 13.10.2025 PTW announced [Daniel Razor's](@/w/daniel-razor.md) Open Challenge for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md).
* On 14.10.2025, Pawłowski [confirmed][konfirmacja] the stakes for the 4 on 4 match. If Team Okoński wins, all the members earn title shots. If they lose, however, they will be forever banned from competing for gold. It is unclear whether the stakes extend to all PTW titles, or only the ones that each of Team Okoński's members is recently going after.
* On 15.10.2025 PTW announced [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) vs [Polski Niedźwiedź](@/w/polski-niedzwiedz.md).
* On 16.10.2025 PTW announced [CJ Klakson](@/w/cj-klakson.md) is going to host an open challenge, where he's going to deliver his signature _manto_ (roughly "beatdown").
* On 19.10.2025 PTW announced Andi ZickZack vs Nic Wesker in a Halloween Hardcore Match.
* On 20.10.2025 PTW announced the return of [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md), who made his PTW debut at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md).
* On 21.10.2025 PTW announced an International Showcase Tag Team Match between the British team The Lancadores (Kenny B. & M.R.D.) vs Italians Ivan Sanzio & Davide Adami of Street Creed.
* On 23.10.2025 PTW officially confirmed the main event: Team Okoński ([Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md), [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) & [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md)) vs [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) ([Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) & [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md)) in a 4 vs 4 Elimination Match.

### Recap

* Street Creed worked the match as heels, whereas The Lancadores (with their manager Tori Fox) played babyfaces.
* Post-match, the heels tried to put an exclamation mark on their victory, continuing the beatdown on The Lancadores. Tori Fox thwarted their attempts, disposing of both Street Creed members.
* Damian Adler, a Polish competitor trained in Germany and a former student of the [KPW school](@/o/szkola-kpw.md), made his debut as Pawłowski's hand-picked opponent for Razor's Open Challenge. Adler worked the match as a heel, presenting a blend of powerhouse style and agility. Razor won with a crucifix pin to retain.
* Sawicki made his entrance wearing a skull mask with facepaint underneath, playing up the Halloween theme of the show. His entrance mimicked [La Parka's][pa-larka].
* Pawłowski entered to pick his opponent, teasing [Boguś](@/w/bogus.md) (working as timekeeper) that this was his chance. However, the one to debut was a fellow PTW rookie, [Bumper](@/w/bumper.md). Sawicki disposed of him in a quick fashion.
* Andi Zick Zack won a Halloween Hardcore Match, followed by a break.
* After the break, Okoński (accompanied by a scantily-clad woman, introduced as Dominika) enters to host a traditional charity auction.
* Just like [a year ago](@/e/ptw/2024-10-19-ptw-underground-23.md), Shida entered wearing a [Ghostface][duchomordy] mask from _Scream_. Polski Niedźwiedź made his entrance as usual. Shida won in a fairly short match, focusing on mutual respect. Him and Bear embraced afterwards.
* Klakson's Manto Challenge turned out to be a Triple Threat Match against two debuting international wrestlers: Dylan Thorn from Scotland and Shawn Aster from the [Country of Aruba][aruba].
* Klakson won fairly quickly, hitting a _Polski Przekręt_ (roughly "the Polish Swindle", a modified Stunner) on Thorn for a pinfall.
* Damian Lambert entered for an unannounced segment. He lamented the turn from the predator to a victim after the previous show. Because of this he couldn't even look people in the eyes.
* Pawłowski came out to choose Lambert's opponent. After once again teasing Boguś with an opportunity, he introduced a fellow rookie, Dropper. Lambert defeated him quickly, making a statement with his victory, and left visibly avoiding any eye contact with the audience.
* Nietykalni made an entrance first, coming as a unit. Members of Team Okoński enter in succession.
* In a slightly comedic fashion, Caravaggio uses the ring of his grandmother Matylda. The only effect it achieved was breaking down a set of chairs placed close to the stage.
* Order of eliminations:
*   Pawłowski eliminated Sigma Boy xD after a Wylew from Puncher and some offense of his own.
*   Puncher eliminated Okoński after a Wylew and a Curb Stomp.
*   Spartan eliminated Alex Brave after a Spartan Bomb.
*   Lopez turned on Spartan, hitting him with a chair. Thus, Starboy was eliminated by DQ.
*   Puncher eliminated Spartan, picking up a win for his team.
* After Nietykalni won, Nano Lopez embraced them and celebrated together, thus joining the faction.
