During [PTW x RyuCon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md), [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) owner [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) announced a summer training camp to be held in August, concluding with another PTW Underground show, but did not give precise dates.
Both are to be held in Kozłów, Dworek Pod Platanem, which is a complex containing guest rooms, sport facilities and a hall where wrestling shows can be held.

This Underground show is the first one to have an individual title, not just a number.

## Build-up

* On July 19 2024, PTW updated their Facebook cover photo, confirming dates for both the camp and the show. The training camp will start on Sunday August 18, and the show is to be held on the next Sunday, August 25.
* On August 8th, the official poster was revealed, prominently featuring Maverick and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) suggesting a main event between the two.

### Change in ticketing

On August 7th, PTW announced a "partnership" with ticket platforms Going and empik. Their previous ticket platform was kupbilecik (also used by [KPW](@/o/kpw.md)).
For the first time ever, PTW introduced VIP tickets for an Underground show, in a very limited number of 20 seats. With a premium price (150PLN, or about 35EUR at the time, twice the regular ticket cost) they also promise a premium experience: ringside seats, snacks, drinks, merchandise discounts. This new ticket policy seems to disregard the "first come first serve" principle that PTW always followed in regards to seats at the Underground shows.
