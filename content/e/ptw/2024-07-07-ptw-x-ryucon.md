[PTW](@/o/ptw.md) organized this show, for the third consecutive year, in collaboration with Ryucon, an anime/manga themed fan convention held annually in Kraków. The event was held in Tauron Arena on Sunday July 7th, 2024.

For this show, a significant portion of the match card was filled by guest wrestlers from abroad, including 5 from Hungary. The guest performers were:
* Hungarian tag team The Gulyas Brothers: Gulyas Öcsi and Gulyas Vilmos.
* Hungarian wrestlers Blaze and Svedberg, both making their second appearance after [PTW Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md).
* Hungarian wrestler Iva Kolasky, also in her second appearance after [PTW Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md).
* Italian wrestlers Luca Bjorn and Rust.
* British wrestler Joseph Conners, one-time WCPW Champion and former NXT UK perfomer.

### Build-up

* With the recent string of talent exits from PTW, and the organization's future uncertain, fans were speculating about PTW#6 being the last event.
* When Pawłowski and Ryucon both announced the show, speculation moved to the card - how many matches could they still build.
* Diana Strong vs Iva Kolasky was the first all-female main event in PTW. While both rivals have faced multiple times on the European indy scene, they only clashed once before in PTW at [Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md), where Diana Strong was victorious.
* More matches have been hinted at, including a multi-man match, a tag-team match, and a surprise appearance.
* On Monday July 1st, PTW posted a match graphic revealing a tag team match. Except for Caravaggio, every competitor in that match comes from the Hungarian scene.
  Svedberg has previously made a single PTW appearance, competing in the Contract Battle Royal at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md) in a losing effort. Gulyas Öcsi meanwhile, makes his PTW debut shortly after appearing at [KPW Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md), in a rare occurrence for the Polish scene, where foreign workers are mostly exclusive to particular organizations.
* [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) & Alex Brave continued their feud.
  During the [lottery stream](@/o/ptw.md#the-prize-draw), Brave interrupted Speed, telling him to "Speed the fuck out" ("Speedalaj") and received a superkick for his troubles.
  He spent a few minutes laying motionless, while the lottery draft continued.
  There was no further interaction between the two, but fans speculated it might be a build up for a future match.
* On July 2nd, Speed uploaded a gym video on his Instagram.
  In the video, Speed was busy training, while Brave came in and interrupted him with trash talk.
  Speed responded with the same and another superkick to Brave, then laid out a challenge for a match at PTW x Ryucon 3. \
  PTW later reposted the video on their Facebook, declaring that possible match is awaiting confirmation from Pan Pawłowski.
