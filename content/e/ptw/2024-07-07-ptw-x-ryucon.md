This is an upcoming show by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) in collaboration with Ryucon, an anime/manga themed fan convention held annually in Kraków. The event will be held in Tauron Arena on Sunday July 7th, 2024.

### Build-up

* With the recent string of talent exits from PTW, and the organization's future uncertain, fans were speculating about PTW#6 being the last event.
* When Pawłowski and Ryucon both announced the show, speculation moved to the card - how many matches could they still build.
* Diana Strong vs Iva Kolasky will be the first all-female main event in PTW. While both rivals have faced multiple times on the European indy scene, they only clashed once before in PTW at [Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md), where Diana Strong was victorious.
* More matches have been hinted at, including a multi-man match, a tag-team match, and a surprise appearance.
* On Monday July 1st, PTW posted a match graphic revealing a tag team match. Except for Caravaggio, every competitor in that match comes from the Hungarian scene.
  Svedberg has previously made a single PTW appearance, competing in the Contract Battle Royal at [Underground 9](@/e/ptw/2022-10-30-ptw-underground-9.md) in a losing effort. Gulyas Öcsi meanwhile, makes his PTW debut shortly after appearing at [KPW Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md), in a rare occurrence for the Polish scene, where foreign workers are mostly exclusive to particular organizations.
* [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) & Alex Brave continued their feud.
  During the [lottery stream](@/o/ptw.md#the-prize-draw), Brave interrupted Speed, telling him to "Speed the fuck out" ("Speedalaj") and received a superkick for hist troubles.
  He spent a few minutes laying motionless, while the lottery draft continued.
  There was no further interaction between the two, but fans speculated it might be a build up for a future match.
* On July 2nd, Speed uploaded a gym video on his Instagram.
  In the video, Speed was busy training, while Brave came in and interrupted him with trash talk.
  Speed gave him a trash talk of his own and another superkick, then laid out a challenge for a match at PTW x Ryucon 3.

PTW later reposted the video on their Facebook, declaring that possible match is awaiting confirmation from Pan Pawłowski.
