The Mystery was held on June 25, 2023 in Wrocław, specifically in [MZW's](@/o/mzw.md) home turf of [Czasoprzestrzeń](@/v/czasoprzestrzen.md). Cryptic promos from [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) aired all throughout the build-up to this show, and the show's title might be referring to them. The theme of this show was all about mysteries - with the trailers showing Puncher beating down a hooded figure tied to a chair in the middle of the ring, while PTW crew were portrayed as forensic analysts, criminals and policemen.

This was the fourth major event in PTW's history, and the first one to air on paid-tier YouTube. The event sparked controversy, due to lower starpower than the previous three main events (a result of titular sponsor Kinguin pulling out) and video streaming cutting off for many users.
A fixed version called "The Final Cut", free from quality issues, was released later on August 24, 2023.

There were two new foreign guests on this event: French female wrestler Amale, who competed on NXT UK since 2020 until its suspension in 2022; and Hungarian high-flyer Peter Tihanyi. Amale would face [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md).

## Build-up

* With [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) leaving PTW, [Axel Fox](@/w/jakub.md) was left without a tag team partner. The match was billed as Axel + mystery partner of his choice vs the Budapest Bastards.
* By 2023, [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) was primarily competing for various Danish organizations: mainly BODYSLAM!, Nordic Elite Wrestling, and Dansk Pro Wrestling. He appeared for PTW sparingly, despite being in the first major show's main event. This would be his final appearance for PTW, although he was still featured on its roster page.

### Recap

* At the beginning, PTW revealed the new Tag Team Championship belts, to mixed reactions.
* [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) intervened on [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)'s behalf, helping him secure the win. They formed a tag team, and declared their wish to challenge for the PTW Tag Team Championship.
* After [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md)' match, [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) appeared and challenged him.
* Karol "[Iskra](@/w/iskra.md)" Górski entered the break, in his hands a petition for Pawłowski to give him a match. This petition is rejected, and Iskra must watch the next match from ringside.
* [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) Rarytas is carried out on a stretcher. Longman cut a promo discussing the match results. Called out [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) to the ring, and after a brief exchange of words, laid him out with At Your Service. [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) recovered, pushed away Pawłowski, grabbed a microphone and called out to [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md).
* "I've got you babe" promo from Sinister played, as he made his entrance with Krampus. It turned out that the promo was Sinister's offer for [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) to join him. Dziedzic is hugged by Sinister, only to receive Krampus's finisher seconds later. Krampus carried Dziedzic on their way out.
* The tournament finals to crown PTW's inaugural Tag Team Champions were a Tables match. PAKA made a special entrance to the Scooby Doo theme, driving a Mystery Machine.
* Newly allied [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) interfered in the match after a bump that took Ref Seweryn out. [Boro](@/w/boro.md), the third member of PAKA entered and chased off the heels with a kendo stick.
* Pawłowski was in the ring to close the show, when the officially fired' "Bad Bones" Klinger appeared on the big screen. Klinger requested Pawłowski to reinstate him, and to give him a title match.
* When Pawłowski rejected his offer, the screen revealed a chair, with a tied down Marcin "Rzeźnik" Rzeźniczek, co-owner of PTW. Klinger beat up Rzeźniczek and threatened to cut off his fingers with pliers. This convinced Pawłowski to reinstate Klinger.
* On-screen, Klinger laid out Rzeźniczek with a punch, then carried him, stunned and still tied up, to the entrance stage. Pawłowski sent the security team after them, who chased Bones away. The show ends with Pawłowski checking on Rzeźniczek. This story would be later continued at [PTW #5 Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md).
