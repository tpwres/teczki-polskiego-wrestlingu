After [Underground 22](@/e/ptw/2024-08-25-ptw-underground-22.md) concluded, PTW's social media channels didn't reveal a date for the next show.
However, some weeks later, they announced a charity show to take place in Kozłów.
The event's title is simply "Fighting for the Foundation", where the foundation in question is "Fundacja Nadzieja Dzieci" (_Children's Hope Foundation_).
The event is officially not a part of the Underground series, but it was confirmed that it would continue storylines and feuds from those events.
