"Odrodzenie" (_The Rebirth_) is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). It was announced at [Świąt Nie Będzie](@/e/ptw/2025-12-13-ptw-swiat-nie-bedzie.md) in a post-show interview with [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).

This is the second PTW show - following [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) - to share a name with a [KPW event](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md).

## Build-up

* In the [video interview][smutny-arek] posted on 16.12.2025 [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) said that he'd be quitting PTW, citing his age, corpulence and poor physical and mental condition, following the turn of events of Świąt Nie Będzie. Pawłowski then chastised rookie Boguś for betraying him and his team, thus taking away the dream Arek had worked for his entire life. He followed this by stating that he wants to say goodbye to the fans and to PTW (in his own, uncensored way), which will likely be the last wrestling-related thing he does.
* The first match of the event, announced on 17.01.2026, was Damian Adler vs [CJ Klakson](@/w/cj-klakson.md).
* Two days later PTW announced that ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) will defend his [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) in an Open Challenge.
* On 20.01.2025 PTW announced a match between the reigning champions [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md) ([Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) & [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md)) and Miyagi Sigma ([Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) & [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md)) for the [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md).
* A few hours later [Polski Niedźwiedź](@/w/polski-niedzwiedz.md) was confirmed to make an appearance at the show.
