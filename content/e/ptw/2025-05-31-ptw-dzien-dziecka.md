"Dzień Dziecka" (_Children's Day_) was a show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

## Build-up

* The Facebook event page suggests the following:
  * [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) in action
  * ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) returns, having recovered from his alleged injury (which did not affect his international bookings)
  * [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) in action
  * [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) to defend his [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md)
  * [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) and [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) to make a co-announcement
* Fed up with Pawłowski's bullying, referees [Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) and [Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md) stood up to him. In a pre-recorded announcement they refused to carry Puncher's belts around, but Pawłowski stepped in and bullied them further. He gave them an ultimatum&nbsp;- read an announcement prepared by Pawłowski, or be terminated. Referees had no choice but to comply and publicly pledge allegiance to Pawłowski.
* On May 15th Klaudiusz uploaded a video of him and Okoński, in which the Chairman promised to help him resolve the issue.
* Following up on their feud including arena brawls, Shida and Sullivan will compete in a Falls Count Anywhere match.
* On May 23rd PTW confirmed the challenger for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) - the returning Gulyás Öcsi, making his PTW singles debut.
* In a [Facebook video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1056182143186831) on PTW  fanpage, Italian referee Daniele Specchiulli cuts a heelish promo, announcing his return to PTW, calling out [Sędzia Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md) and [Sędzia Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md).

### Recap

* In the opening segment, Okoński, accompanied by an unnamed female valet, brought out Spartan and both referees. He gave praise to each of them, reinstated Spartan and bade farewell to everyone, seemingly leaving PTW.
* Conte, who'd requested a match prior to the show, came out to challenge Spartan. Spartan won with a _Spartan Bomb_.
* Post-match, the show went to a technical break due to ring malfunction.
* Nano Lopez came out wearing a suit, said he was glad to be back and announced he was ready for competition. Pawłowski came out, first praising him, but then buried him for never winning a big one. He offered him a chance to finally become a champion, in a [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) match with a partner hand-picked by Pawłowski. Should Lopez lose, he'd lose the boss's favour and would need to earn his every championship opportunity.
* Lopez left, Pawłowski introduced Alex Brave and Vincent Caravaggio. He gave them a new tag team name: Royal Rebels. Then he introduced Puncher. Pawłowski praised all three and granted each of them a favour. Alex Brave was allowed to host The Brave Show once again - at the next show, with the best guest ever, Pawłowski himself. Puncher's gift was a harder opponent: Ben Rodgers. Vincent didn't get his wish, because even Pawłowski can't resurrect Caravaggio's late grandmother. However, he offered him and Brave a chance to become champions. He announced the formation of a new faction - "Nietykalni" (_The Untouchables_), consisting of all three competitors and Pawłowski.
* Sigma Boy xD defeated El G with his finisher, _Sigma Destroyer_ (Canadian destroyer).
* Nano Lopez made his entrance for the tag team match. Pawłowski announced his partner, a [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) trainee, Daniel Razor. Mid-match, Pawłowski stated he "forgot to announce" the Royal Rebels and "forgot to mention" that this was a Tornado Tag Team Match. The Royal Rebels win, with Brave pinning Razor. New champions quickly left and two originally competing teams shook hands. Razor was already over big time and got an ovation from the crowd.
* Max Speed retained his PTW Underground Championship against Gulyás Öcsi after a fierce match.
* The show then went to a scheduled break.
* Musical performance by an up-and-coming rapper, Tester.
* Charity auction for a commemorative T-shirt.
* Diana Strong defeated Kiara to retain her Glam! Championship, usually contested in the Austrian promotion, Rings of Europe. This is the first time that a Polish female wrestler defends a women's title on Polish soil. Over the match, commentary reminded the viewers that the [PTW Women's Championship](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md) is still pending and strongly hinted at a future tournament match between Diana and Heidi Katrina.
* Sullivan and Shida made their entrance for their Falls Count Anywhere Match. They brawled throughout the arena. Sullivan's wife Lesya was watching closely, concerned for her husband. Sullivan won after an elbow drop from the ladder, putting Shida through the table. Lesya helped Sullivan out.
* Rodgers made his entrance for the championship match first. Puncher made a champion's entrance, as usual, flanked by Klaudiusz and Herno holding his belts. While Klaudiusz attempted to start officiating the match, Pawłowski removed him and announced Daniele Specchiulli as his replacement. Puncher beat Rodgers in a match that was not long, but intense.
* Pawłowski put Rodgers over with the crowd and moved to the closing segment of the show. The crowd chanted for Okoński, but Pawłowski shut it down. He announced that during Children's Day festivities in the area the following day, PTW was going to hold an additional, non-televised show.
* Pawłowski brought out both Polish referees and said he wasn't pleased with their work. He questioned the necessity of their employment with referee Daniele being available. Pawłowski continued rambling that they should leave PTW just like Okoński had in the beginning of the show, when Okoński's theme song hit. Pawłowski watched the entrance way, waiting for Okoński - who was already standing behind him with a camera. Pawłowski continued rambling about Okoński being out and when he finally turned back, Okoński laid him out using the camera as a weapon. The Royal Rebels make a save allowing Pawłowski to regroup. They attempted to fight Okoński, but Spartan evened the odds. Pawłowski tried to go back into the fray with a chair, but Okoński took it away. With Pawłowski running away, Okoński hit a chairshot to the already laid out Caravaggio. Okoński grabbed a mic and said that the era of Pawłowski was over. On his cue, the referees covered the Pawłowski banner hanging on the wall with a new one, depicting Okoński. Okoński and Spartan celebrated, parodying the pose of Nietykalni.
* Skwarczyński closed the show.
