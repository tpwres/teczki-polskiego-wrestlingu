"Dzień Dziecka" (_Children's Day_) is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

## Build-up

* The Facebook event page suggests the following:
  * [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) in action
  * ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) returns, having recovered from his alleged injury (which did not affect his international bookings)
  * [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) in action
  * [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) to defend his [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md)
  * [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) and [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) to make a co-announcement
* Fed up with Pawłowski's bullying, referees [Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) and [Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md) stood up to him. In a pre-recorded announcement they refused to carry Puncher's belts around, but Pawłowski stepped in and bullied them further. He gave them an ultimatum&nbsp;- read an announcement prepared by Pawłowski, or be terminated. Referees had no choice but to comply and publicly pledge allegiance to Pawłowski.
* On May 15th Klaudiusz uploaded a video of him and Okoński, in which the Chairman promised to help him resolve the issue.
* Following up on their feud including arena brawls, Shida and Sullivan will compete in a Falls Count Anywhere match.
* On May 23rd PTW confirmed the challenger for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) - the returning Gulyás Öcsi, making his PTW singles debut.
* In a [Facebook video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1056182143186831) on PTW  fanpage, Italian referee Daniele Specchiulli cuts a heelish promo, announcing his return to PTW, calling out [Sędzia Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md) and [Sędzia Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md).

## Recap:

* In opening segment, Okoński, accompanied by unnamed female valet, brings out Spartan and both referees. He gives praise to each of them, reinstates Spartan and bids farewell to everyone, presumably leaving PTW.
* Conte, who requested a match prior to the show, came out to challenge Spartan.
* Post match, show went to technical break due to ring malfunction
* Nano Lopez comes out in a suit, says he's glad to be back and announces he's ready for competition. Pawłowski comes out, first praises him, but then buries him for never winning a big one. He offers him a chance to finally become a champion, in a [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) with a partner that Pawłowski handpicked. If Lopez loses, he loses boss' favor and will need to earn every championship opportunity.
* Lopez leaves, Pawłowski introduces Alex Brave and Vincent Caravaggio. He gives them a new tag team name: Royal Rebels. Then he introduces Puncher. Pawłowski praises all three and grants each of them a favor. Alex Brave is allowed to host The Brave Show once again - at the next show, with the best guest ever, Pawłowski himself. Puncher's gift is a harder opponent - Ben Rodgers. Vincent is not getting his wish, because even Pawłowski can't resurrect Caravaggio's late grandmother. However, he offers him and Brave a chance to become a champion. He announces the formation of their new faction - Nietykalni (_Untouchable Ones_), including all three competitors and Pawłowski.
* Sigma Boy xD defeats El G with his finisher, _Sigma Destroyer_(Canadian destroyer)
* Nano Lopez makes his entrance for tag team match. Pawłowski announces his partner, a [PTW Academy](@/o/ptw-academy.md) trainee, Daniel Razor. Mid-match, Pawłowski announced he 'forgot to announce' Royal Rebels and 'forgot to mention' that this is a Tornado tag team match. Royal Rebels win, with Brave pinning Razor. New champions quickly leave and two originally competing teams shake each other's hands. Razor is already over big time and gets an ovation from the crowd.
* Max Speed retains PTW Underground Championship against Gulyás Öcsi after a competitive match.
* Show goes to a scheduled break
* Musical performance by an up-and-coming rapper Tester
* Charity auction for a commemorative T-shirt.
* Sullivan and Shida make their entrance for their Falls Count Anywhere match. They brawl throughout the arena. Sullivan's wife Lesya is watching closely, concerned for her significant one. Sullivan wins after elbow drop from the ladder, putting Shida through the table. Lesya helps Sullivan out.
* Rodgers made his entrance for championship match first. Puncher made a champion's entrance, as usual, flanked by Klaudiusz and Herno holding his belts. While Klaudiusz attempted to start officiating the match, Pawłowski removed him and announced Daniele Specchiulli as his replacement. Puncher beats Rodgers in a match not long, but competitive.
* Pawłowski puts Rodgers over with the crowd and moves to closing segment of the show. Crowd is chanting for Okoński, but Pawłowski shuts it down. He announces that during Children's day festivities in the vicinity the following day, PTW is going to hold an additional, non-televised show.
* Pawłowski brings out both Polish referees and says he's not pleased with their work. He questions necessity of their employment with referee Daniele being available. Pawłowski continues rambling that they should leave PTW just like Okoński did in the beginning of the show, then Okoński's theme song plays. Pawłowski watches the entrance way waiting for Okoński - who's already standing behind him with a camera. Pawłowski continues rambling about Okoński being out and when he finally turns back, Okoński lays him out, using camera as a weapon. Royal Rebels make a save allowing Pawłowski to regroup, they attempt to fight Okoński, but Spartan evens the odds. Pawłowski tries to go back in the fray with a chair, but Okoński takes it away. With Pawłowski running away, Okoński hits a chairshot on already laid out Caravaggio. Okoński grabs a mic and says that the era of Pawłowski is over. On his cue, the referees cover Pawłowski banner hanging on the walls with a new one, depicting Okoński. Okoński and Spartan celebrate, parodying the pose of Nietykalni.
* Skwarczyński closes the show
