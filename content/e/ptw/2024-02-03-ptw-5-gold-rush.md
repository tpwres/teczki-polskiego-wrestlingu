Gold Rush was an event by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) held in {{ map_pin(v="Hotel Scout") }}Hotel Scout in Częstochowa, about 50&nbsp;km north of Chorzów. It was announced as a "Season Finale", which suggested it's going to close some kind of chapter in PTW's history.
The event featured PTW's cast alongside foreign wrestlers from UK, USA, Germany and Italy, including former WWE performers Justin Gabriel (now as PJ Black), Evan Bourne (Matt Sydal, later canceled) and NXT UK's Nina Samuels. Heavily promoted was also the involvement of the former Maximum Male Models tag team, consisting of Mason Madden and Mansoor, who as of 2024 were touring the independent wrestling scene. Another name advertised was James Storm, known for his long tenure in TNA/Impact.

Polish celebrity and former boxer Marcin Najman was also expected to appear in some capacity, as the event was held in his hometown.

## Build-up

* PTW has been teasing the introduction of a singles championship belt for several months. The first champion is going to be crowned in a 20-man royal rumble at this event.
* [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) defeated [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and [Renegade](@/w/renegade.md) on PTW Underground 20, with each wrestler's tag team partners present and involved in the match.
* The day before the event, PTW [posted on Facebook][sydal-facebook-video] that Matt Sydal will not be performing due to unforeseen circumstances. In a video attached to that post, Sydal explained that this was due to passport issues. A replacement of his or higher caliber was announced, to be revealed at the event.
* The surprise, was however spoiled by Lince Dorado, who posted about a last-minute trip to Poland on his Instagram profile.

### Recap

* Speedball immediately won the Polish crowd's support. Delivered his signature fast kicks and running tornado kick.
* After the Nina vs [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md) match, Pawłowski leaked plans to introduce a [women's title](@/c/ptw-womens-championship.md).
* Nano was pinned, but managed to lift one shoulder for the three count. The ref initially awarded [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md) the victory, but as he was about to reverse this decision, Krampus decked him and kicked out of the ring. [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) arrived to deliver more punishment to Lopez.
* Mario Pardua, a wrestler of Polish origin fighting in the Chicago area, introduced himself in a video clip. In Polish, he declared he's ready for Prime Time Wrestling. The crowd chanted CM-PUNK at him. Pawłowski added that Pardua is currently fighting for NWA, and that he's been signed to PTW.
* After Lince Dorado's entrance, [Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md) and [Borkowski](@/w/pawel-borkowski.md) joined the Polish commentary team.
* Lince kicked out of the Styles clash, hitting the ref in the face with his feet. PJ Black hit the Placebo Effect to win.
* MxM received warmly by the audience, only to immediately turn heel and cut a promo calling them and the Polish language ugly. Cue chants of STFU.
* PAKA entered to Bonnie Tyler's _Holding out for a hero_. Coincidentally, the actual Bonnie Tyler was giving a concert in Poland the next day, Sunday Feb 4.
* MxM grabbed the win by Mason pinning Mansoor. However, Pawłowski was furious and ordered the match to continue.
* Marius Al-Ani retained the belt by submission.
* Legia Łysych (Marco hammers & [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md)) entered the ring, Hammers holding an electric shaver. They summoned Karyna, their valet to the ring. Previously in a segment on PTW Underground, they declared that she'd have to shave bald to remain in Legia Łysych. Karyna was nowhere to be seen. \
  Looking for someone else to shave, they started calling out people in the audience, then grabbed a hapless referee to the crowd's disappointment. Then, Marcin Najman appeared and entered the ring. Excited, Legia invited him to join the faction, as he's already bald, and is known by _El Testosteron_. However, in order to join, he must start winning fights in MMA, a reference to his losing streak. \
  Najman took offense to this, referred to himself not as bald, but close cut and decked them with punches. Announced his upcoming fight against Murański at Clout MMA 4 on March 9.
* Pawłowski explained the Gold Rush Rumble rules: typical over-the-top rope elimination, but the final four can only eliminate  by pinfall or submission.
* After the rumble, [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) cut a promo, to be interrupted by Babatunde, an ex-WWE wrestler of Polish origin, now as Babathunder. Pawłowski announced him as signed to PTW.
* Pawłowski invited his fiancée Karolina, to do a proposal segment. Before he got his chance to bend the knee, Longman interrupted him.
* The screen showed a video recalling Rzeźniczak's kidnapping from [PTW #4 Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md), and revealing it was an elaborate ruse by Bones, Rzeżniczak and Longman who are scheming against Pawłowski. The surprised Arkadiusz confronted Longman calling him an idiot. Longman took offense, hit his boss with _At Your Service_, and closed the show by plugging the lottery.
