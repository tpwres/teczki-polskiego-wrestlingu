On 14.09.2025 he posted a [video][viking-video] of a chair standing in the middle of the PTW arena, and still frames referencing the next show, hinting that his debut will take place at Ból Istnienia. The character teases strongly reference Nordic mythology, presenting a hooded bearded figure covered in rune tattoos. Most of the videos are kept in black and purple color palette, including effects such as distorted audio and video, Viking-style singing and crows cawing.

On 16.09.2025 it was confirmed that he will face [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) at Ból Istnienia.
* ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) was confirmed to appear at the show on 17.09.2025, although no match-up was announced.
