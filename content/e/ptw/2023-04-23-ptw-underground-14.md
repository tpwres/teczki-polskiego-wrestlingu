### Recap

* Fed up with not scoring a single win, [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) storyline-quit PTW after his match.
* In a pre-match comedic segment, a promo by Hammers was interrupted by "Dr Fox", in a white lab coat, who offered to cure Hammers's baldness. After Marco's refusal, Dr Fox dropped the disguise to reveal himself as [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), and the match started.
* Post-match, Longman attacked Rarytas, choking him with his "Power of Friendship" T-shirt. Pawłowski stopped the attack, but the furious Longman attempted to attack Pawłowski as well. After a while, Longman collected himself, declared "the boss is always right" and left the ring.
* GM Pawłowski announces a showcase match featuring two foreign wrestlers: Noah Charon and Salomon Strid. After they made their entrances, [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) entered with Karyna and demanded to be added to the match. Pawłowski agrees, making it a Triple Threat.
* [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) bragged about defeating [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) in his pre-match promo, and promised to dispatch any and all women that want to fight him. Insulted [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) and his opponent [Boro](@/w/boro.md).
* [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) who came out to watch the intergender match, assisted [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md) by locking the arena door with [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) still outside. Once opened, Queen rushed to the ring but failed to make the count. [Iskra](@/w/iskra.md) appeared for a segment, offering Diana the position of his girlfriend. Diana refused and slapped him, after which [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) interfered and dropkicked Iskra out of the ring.
* El Ogre appeared and challenged [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), who entered and announced Krampus as Ogre's opponent.
* Golden distracted the referee with his gold chain, and hit a low blow on Joy, but the referee saw that. The match ended with a DQ win for Justin, who stood alone in the ring. Axel Fox entered the ring, and asked whether he can trust Joy. In response, Joy gave Fox his tag team armband, hugged him and whispered something in his ear. Joy left the ring, and the arena, which marked his final appearance for the organization.
* Pure Gold attack Axel, who stood alone in the ring. Fans chanted for [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) to come back, but instead it was PAKA who made the save.
