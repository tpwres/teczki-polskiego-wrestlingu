"Złoto Dla Zuchwałych" (_Gold for the Bold_) is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

The name of the show is a reference to the Polish title of the 1970 film [Kelly's Heroes][zloto].

## Build up

* At the [previous show](content/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md), Pawłowski created his new faction, "Nietykalni" (_The Untouchables_), consisting of [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md), [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) (known together as "Royal Rebels"), [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) and himself. As part of the deal, he granted each of them a favour. For Alex Brave, it was the return of his discontinued talk show segment "The Brave Show" with Pawłowski as a guest, announced for PTW: Złoto Dla Zuchwałych.
