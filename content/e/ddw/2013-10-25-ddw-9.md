This event was infamous for very low attendance: only around 15 people came to see the show. This failure to attract fans caused DDW to suspend their events for almost a year and to focus on training. Following this event, [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) and [Straceniec](@/w/shadow.md) would leave DDW to form [MZW](@/o/mzw.md).

#### Recap

* [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) and [Luxus](@/w/luxus.md) were attacked by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) even before the fight.
* After their fight, Kawaler continued to beat Robert with a kendo stick. Several wrestlers, including Kamil Leśny intervened. Leśny also gets a brutal kendo stick treatment. Kawaler painted Leśny's face with the same symbols he wears.
* [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) avoided elimination by hopping on one leg, and waiting  at ringside. Then she hit a low-blow on the prospective winner, to immediately throw him out and claim victory.
* Damian Dunne seeked revenge for his brother Pete [two years earlier](@/e/ddw/2012-03-09-ddw-6.md). After the match, accepted [Klarys](@/w/klarys.md)' handshake and both raised arms together, only for Dunne to deliver a kick to the softies.
* Pacjent knocks out Kamil with a kendo stick, then runs out chasing Pawłowski. Grabbing the opportunity, Aurora pins Kamil for the win.
* [Janusz Wojnarowicz][wojnarowicz], multiple time European judo champion, made a guest appearance and shook hands with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) who's his favourite wrestler.
* [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) appeared with another of his challenges to find the new top guy of DDW. Fight spills out to ringside, Mateusz taps out to Donaconda.
* Afterwards, Don Roid reportedly declared he's done with wrestling in Rzeszów. This would prove true, as after two more shows they relocated to Gdańsk.
