All Or Nothing II was the last show to be held in DDW's usual venue, [klub Pod Palmą](@/v/pod-palma.md), on August 17 2014. The event was built around a tournament for the vacant [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) of which [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) was the previous holder. DDW also held a [smaller show](@/e/ddw/2014-08-16-ddw-pokaz-adeptow.md) the previous day, featuring their trainees.

Another big (literally) feature of the event was Polish Giant, an up-and-coming wrestler of Polish origin and extra large stature (210&nbsp;cm tall, weighing 140&nbsp;kg), who trained in the UK for several years and did tryouts with both [WWE](@/o/wwe.md) and TNA at the time.

### Aftermath

* Polish Giant turned out to be poorly trained and dangerous in the ring, and might have exaggerated his pro wrestling resume.
* [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) claimed that the Giant was unprofessional and a diva, and clashed with him about money.
* The Attitude Forum later interviewed Giant, who declared he's done with wrestling, and had sour words about the Polish wrestling scene.
* Fans enjoyed the other matches, and criticised Giant.
