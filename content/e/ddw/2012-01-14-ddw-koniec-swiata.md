Koniec Świata (_The End of the World_) was a cancelled event by [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), planned for Saturday, January 14th, 2012. The venue was to be a multipurpose sports hall in Twardogóra, a town about 50&nbsp;km north-east of Wrocław.

No card is known for this event, although the poster advertises a main event between [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) & Omen vs [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) & Big Van Walter.
Later promo material also mentions a tag team match between Jędruś Bułecka plus a mystery partner versus Kevin Williams and Luke Xavier. Other matches announced were Rob Cage vs Mr News, and Bravehart vs Claymore for the Scottish Wresting Entertainment Heavyweight Championship.
Other names advertised are Pete Dunne and [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).

According to a statement posted just a day prior on Attitude Forum, DDW was not to blame for the cancellation. The reasons remain undisclosed. Fans speculated about poor ticket sales and choice of location as the main causes.
