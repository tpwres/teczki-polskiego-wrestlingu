Koniec Świata (_End Of The World_) was a cancelled event by [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), planned for Saturday, January 14th 2012. The venue was to be a multipurpose sports hall in Twardogóra, a town about 50km northeast of Wrocław.

No card is known for this event, although the poster advertises a main event between [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) & Omen vs [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) & Big Van Walter. Other names advertised are [Kevin Williams](@/w/kevin-williams.md), [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md), Pete Dunne, Rob Cage and [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).

According to a statement posted just a day prior on Attitude Forum, DDW was not to blame for the cancellation. The reasons remain undisclosed. Fans speculated about poor ticket sales and choice of location as the main causes.
