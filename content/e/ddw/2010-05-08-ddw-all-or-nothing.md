### Recap

* Initially the show was planned for 17.04.2010, however the date was pushed to May due to a period of national mourning following the [Smoleńsk disaster][smolensk-wiki] on 10.04.2010.
* The official poster featured Chris Botherway and Adam Polak, who didn't appear at the show - possibly due to the changed date.
* Ring announcer Edyta can be seen swaying to the theme songs of some of the wrestlers, like John Hammer, Don Roid and Kamil Aleksander. She also received some chants 
* Jon Hammer unintentionally eliminated himself while eliminating The Greatest.
* Battle Royal order of eliminations:
  1. Klarys by Rider
  2. Dirtbag by Jędruś Bułecka
  3. Rob Cage by The Greatest
  4. Joe Legend by Jędruś Bułecka
  5. Don Roid by Rider
  6. The Greatest by Jon Hammer
  7. Jon Hammer by himself
  8. Kamil Aleksander by Jędruś Bułecka
  9. Rider by Jędruś Bułecka
* As Jędruś Bułecka was celebrating his victory, Kamil Aleksander came into the ring and struck Jędruś in the back with his own shepherd's axe (_ciupaga_).
* After the Battle Royal, [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) entered the ring and started cutting a promo, earning him "Gdzie mutacja?" (_Where's the voice change?_) chants, in reference to his high pitch. In his promo Pawłowski promised that the [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) would be defended not only in DDW, but in various federations all over the world. He then introduced two people he considered "sure-fire" candidates for the Championship: The Road Devils, [Rider](@/w/asmund.md) and Dirtbag.
* Before the Gauntlet Match began, announcer Edyta said she heard that the show is being recorded for Japanese TV. Indeed, a Japanese TV programme "S-Arena" later ran a [short segment][jp-tv] featuring footage from this show.
* At the start of the Gauntlet Match there were some "Attitude!" chants, most likely initiated by users of the [Attitude Forum][atti].
* During Klarys vs Dirtbag, there was a chant "Zostaw Klarysa, ty tchórzu, zostaw Klarysa!" (_Leave Klarys alone, you coward!_). This appears to be the earliest recorded usage of the [popular chant](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#calls-to-action), later commonly heard at [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) shows.
* Later during the match, as the referee was distracted by Rider, Arkadiusz Pawłowski climbed into the ring to delived a running kick to Klarys when he was down. Dirtbag followed that with a pin, but Klarys kicked out.
* Shortly after Klarys defeatet Dirtbag, Rob Cage ran into the ring and attacked the winner, transitioning into the next fight.
* The referee from the previous fight had already left the ring, but the other official didn't yet come to take his place, meaning the bulk of the match was merely a brawl. Only after Cage fell Klarys with a DDW did the new referee come into the ring, prompting an angry reaction from Rob. The English wrestler then pinned Klarys and the referee moved to count but, remembering that the match hadn't officially begun yet, gestured for the bell (again eliciting an angry response from Cage) and only then started counting. Even though it was only a two-count, Rob's music started playing for a few seconds, causing the audience to chant "You fucked up!".

* 67509 // audio delay +900
* 
* It was the last DDW show to be held in [Karuzela club](@/v/karuzela.md).
* The event was later released as a two-disc DVD set, in very limited numbers. In addition to the show, the set also contained bonus materials (mostly promos). Fans could purchase it for 35&nbsp;PLN by e-mailing [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md).
* The audio from the show appears to be incorrectly recorded, or perhaps poorly mastered for DVD, as it is on the left stereo channel only.
* The video appears to have been recorded in both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios, depending on the camera, but the DVD was mastered entirely in 4:3. This results in some of the shots to appear horizontally squeezed.
