### Recap

* Initially the show was planned for 17.04.2010, however the date was pushed to May due to a period of national mourning following the [Smoleńsk disaster][smolensk-wiki] on 10.04.2010.
* Ring announcer Edyta can be seen swaying to the theme songs of some of the wrestlers, like John Hammer, Don Roid and Kamil Aleksander.
* Jon Hammer unintentionally eliminated himself while eliminating The Greatest.
* Battle Royal order of eliminations:
  1. Klarys by Rider
  2. Dirtbag by Jędruś Bułecka
  3. Rob Cage by The Greatest
  4. Joe Legend by Jędruś Bułecka
  5. Don Roid by Rider
  6. The Greatest by Jon Hammer
  7. Jon Hammer by himself
  8. Kamil Aleksander by Jędruś Bułecka
  9. Rider by Jędruś Bułecka
* As Jędruś Bułecka was celebrating his victory, Kamil Aleksander came into the ring and struck Jędruś in the back with his own shepherd's axe (_ciupaga_).

* It was the last DDW show to be held in [Karuzela club](@/v/karuzela.md).
* The event was later released as a two-disc DVD set, in very limited numbers. In addition to the show, the set also contained bonus materials (mostly promos). Fans could purchase it for 35&nbsp;PLN by e-mailing [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md).
* The audio from the show appears to be incorrectly recorded, or perhaps poorly mastered for DVD, as it is on the left stereo channel only.
* The video appears to have been recorded in both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios, depending on the camera, but the DVD was mastered entirely in 4:3. This results in some of the shots to appear horizontally squeezed.
