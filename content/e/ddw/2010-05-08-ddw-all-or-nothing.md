### Recap

* Initially the show was planned for 17.04.2010, however the date was pushed to May due to a period of national mourning following the [Smoleńsk disaster][smolensk-wiki] on 10.04.2010.
* 
* 7009
* 




* It was the last DDW show to be held in [Karuzela club](@/v/karuzela.md).
* The event was later released as a two-disc DVD set, in very limited numbers. In addition to the show, the set also contained bonus materials (mostly promos). Fans could purchase it for 35&nbsp;PLN by e-mailing [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md).
* The audio from the show appears to be incorrectly recorded, or perhaps poorly mastered for DVD, as it is on the left stereo channel only.
* Similarly, the video was recorded in 16:9 aspect ratio but seemingly mastered at 4:3, perhaps due to a botched anamorphic setting. As a result, while captions with wrestlers' names and the DDW logo look right, people's bodies are visibly squished horizonstally. (Note: all the screengrabs from the DVD in the gallery below were resized to proper 16:9, resulting in the opposite problem of captions looking stretched when compared to the rest of the image.)
