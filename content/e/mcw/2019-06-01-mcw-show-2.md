This event took place as a part of a Children's Day festival in Siemianowice Śląskie, held at a {{ map_pin(v="Szkoła Podstawowa nr 4") }}local primary school. Accompanying the event was a children's bench press tournament.

No card or results were posted online; the information below is based on the official poster and a conversation with [Johny Vegas](@/w/johny-vegas.md). According to Vegas, there was supposed to be a third fight - presumably Terror against an unspecified opponent(s) - however midway through the event the school director stopped the show on the grounds of it being too brutal (despite there being no unusual stipulations), and threatened to call the police. Vegas says he visited the director a few months prior to discuss the details and showed her videos of previous MCW shows, much to the director's approval.
