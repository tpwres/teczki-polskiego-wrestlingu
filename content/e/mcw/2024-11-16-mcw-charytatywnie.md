#### Recap
* The show accompanied other events. During the fights, people can be seen walking around, including a couple of mascots and some people in karate gi.
* The entire show was shot with a single camera, leading to some "cinematic" pans around the ring to catch a better angle.
* The debutant Phantom came out to the ring led by a female valet on a piece of rope, which tied his hands and ended in a noose around his neck.
* [Johny Vegas's](@/w/johny-vegas.md) foot hit the camera while he was being thrown into the ring by Chris Steeler.
* [RAV](@/w/rav.md) apparently botched a Suicide Dive when his knee caught the top rope, forcing Kalom to rush in to catch him.
* After the main event, RAV called Johny Vegas to the ring, cut a short promo and gave him a gift to show his gratitude for everything Vegas had done: a large print of Johny's photo from the [2022 show](@/e/mcw/2022-10-15-mcw-charity-show.md) and a box of chocolate bars. The crowd, urged by RAV, sang _Sto lat_ (typically heard at birthdays, but also other occasions, to wish a person a long life).
* The show ends with the commentator saying "Don't try this at home, or in your back yard, because it's dangerous".
