In December 2018 MCW began cooperation with Sekcja Sportów Siłowych (_Stength Sports Section_) from Siemianowice Śląskie, thus getting an opportunity to put together a show in front of around 200 people. The event took place around Sait Nicholas Day, which in Poland always falls on the 6th of December - the exact date might of the show might differ slightly. The event was held in a gym hall of what appears to be a local school.
