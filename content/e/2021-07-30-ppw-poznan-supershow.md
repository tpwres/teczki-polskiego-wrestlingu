This event was an sideshow held as part of Poznań Beer Expo 2021. The event featured wrestlers from [PPW](@/o/ppw.md) competing against several [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) regulars in their first, historic collaboration. PPW would return to that event two years later at [Piwo Przyjacielem Wrestlingu](@/e/2023-11-24-ppw-piwo-przyjacielem-wrestlingu.md), and they would hold another co-branded show later that same year ([Żadnych Granic](@/e/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md)).

While this wasn't [Isnorr's](@/w/isnorr.md) debut for PPW, as that was a month before at the first [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md), he would become a regular competitor in PPW's ring from then on. As the hometown hero of Poznań, he won two singles matches and the rumble, for a very strong showing.

The card listed is approximate and incomplete, and covers both days of the event. The event was held on PPW's soft-padded ring.

#### Recap

* Isnorr pulled a large hammer from under the ring, and uses it to attack Esteban, to later win with a spear on the stunned opponent.
* Johnny found a large construciton stapler under the ring. Warned by the ref that using it on his opponent will cause a DQ, Johnny stapled a card to his own chest. Later, he hit Adam with a Kendo stick while the ref was looking away, and pinned him for the win.
* In the Royal Rumble match, after Direk was eliminated by Isnorr, he brought a wooden beach chair to the ring, and hit Rob Scaffold in the back. Hades removed the belt from Esteban's kimono and used it to choke him on the ring apron. Later, Hades fought Isnorr with kendo sticks. Isnorr won by a high kick to Hades to throw him off the corner turnbuckle onto the floor.
* PPW's Mister Z is billed as his former, backyard persona Cade Bruce. Later, he landed painfully on the barriers while brawling outside the ring. In the finish, missed a flying stomp, and ate a Helluva Kick from Charlie who then pins him.
* While outside the ring, Czacha stole a newspaper from an audience member, then sat on a chair to comically disguise himself. Esteban wasn't fooled, and hit him with a beach chair, followed by the actual chair Czacha was sitting on. Later Esteban found a piece of drywall under the ring, gorilla pressed Czacha into it, and followed with a splash.
* Immediately after the fight, Esteban demanded a new opponent, and Adam Wong answered.
* An exhausted Isnorr asked a fan to help him carry a table into the ring, to almost land on it immediately. Speared Hades into the table later to win.
