[OldTown Festival][oldtown] was an annual LARP event, that billed itself as the largest post-apocalyptica LARP in Europe. It was held since 2005 at the grounds of former Soviet era [military airfield][airfield-wiki] in Kluczewo, near Stargard in West Pomerania. While the community is still active, the 2022 and 2023 editions were cancelled. Instead of the latter one, a [meetup][oldtown-meetup] was held during [Pyrkon][pyrkon] 2023, and since 2024, Pyrkon's post-apocalyptic cosplay event largely replaced it.
The event's name is derived from the town of Stargard, which literally translates as Old Town.

In 2018 the event lasted an entire week, between July 13 and 19. KPW held a wrestling exhibition during the event's second day. KPW would return to following editions of OldTown until 2019.
