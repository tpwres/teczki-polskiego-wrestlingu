[OldTown Festival][oldtown] is an annual LARP event, that bills itself as the largest post-apocalyptica LARP in Europe. It was held annually since 2005 at the grounds of former Soviet era [military airfield][airfield-wiki] in Kluczewo, near Stargard in West Pomerania, Poland. While the event and community is still active, the 2022 and 2023 editions were cancelled. Instead of the latter one, a [meetup][oldtown-meetup] was held during [Pyrkon][pyrkon] 2023.
The event's name is derived from the town of Stargard, which literally translates as Old Town.

In 2018 the event lasted an entire week, between July 13 and 19. KPW held a wrestling exhibition during the event's second day. KPW would return to following editions of OldTown until 2019.

#### Build-up

* Robert Star is forced to join Kawaleria after previously losing to Piękny Kawaler
* British wrestlers Dom Taylor and Lee Rogers debut for KPW. Taylor would later appear several more times for the organization.
