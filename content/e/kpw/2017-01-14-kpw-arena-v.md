The fifth Arena show, this time numbered with a Roman V instead of an Arabic 5, was the first event to be held in [Atlantic](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md), a music club and bar located in the very center of Gdynia.

The main event featured British wrestler Pastor William Eaver, a former PROGRESS wrestling champion and UK scene mainstay from 2013 until 2021. This would be his only KPW appearance.

#### Recap

* [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) was the special referee for the main event, and featured on the show poster in a ref's attire. Previously she'd refereed Kawaler vs [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) at [Arena 3](@/e/kpw/2016-06-11-kpw-arena-3.md).
* Eaver initially won by pinfall, but [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) later reversed the decision and restarted the match as Kawaler was seen grabbing the ropes.
* In the post-match brawl, Kawaleria attacked [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md), and tried to powerbomb her into Eaver's crotch. Kawaler himself landed a flying elbow on it later.
* The beaten up Eaver left the ring to chants of "Believe!"
