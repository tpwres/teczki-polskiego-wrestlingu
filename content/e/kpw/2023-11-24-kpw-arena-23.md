Zabójcze Wyzwanie (_Lethal Challenge_) was held on Friday, November 24, 2023, in the [Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) club.

KPW invited one new foreign guest: young Austrian wrestler Ritshy Rage. Returning were one half of the British Bouncer Club Dom Taylor, and current KPW Champion, Italian masked wrestler Red Scorpion.

#### Build-up

* At the [previous event](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md), Leon Lato challenged Red Scorpion for his championship, cashing in the contract he just won in a battle royal.
* Dawid Oliwa, after his defeat at the hands of Iestyn Rees, was carried out on a stretcher, and didn't come out post-event to meet with the fans., A new, darker, angrier Oliwa faces a crisis.
* This event was lightly promoted, with no vignettes or promos posted on social media. The only material to be posted was Chairman Malinowski and referee Krystian Czekaja [discussing the upcoming match card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m95lInSi6UE).

#### Recap

* After the event, Chairman Krystian Malinowski announced that subsequent events will be broadcast, on tape delay, on the FightBox TV channel, which specializes in all sorts of combat sports and wrestling.
