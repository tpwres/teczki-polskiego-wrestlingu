Zabójcze Wyzwanie (_The Deadly Challenge_) was held on Friday, November 24, 2023, in the [Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) club.

KPW invited one new foreign guest: young Austrian wrestler Ritshy Rage. Returning were one half of the British Bouncer Club Dom Taylor, and reigning KPW Champion, Italian masked wrestler Red Scorpion.

## Build-up

* At the [previous event](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md), Leon Lato challenged Red Scorpion for his championship, cashing in the contract he just won in a battle royal.
* David Oliwa, after his defeat at the hands of Iestyn Rees, was carried out on a stretcher, and didn't come out post-event to meet with the fans. A new, darker, angrier Oliwa faces a crisis.
* This event was lightly promoted, with no vignettes or promos posted on social media. The only material to be posted was Chairman Malinowski and referee Krystian Czekaj [discussing the upcoming match card][analiza-8].

### Recap

* Rosetti presented the new [KPW OldTown Championship belt](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), which has a more traditional, leather plate design. However, he declined to fight due to injury, but found a replacement in another member of the Gregorian Branch faction, Eryk Lesak, returning after a long absence.
* At the start of the event, Chairman Krystian Malinowski announced that subsequent events would be broadcast (taped) on the FightBox TV channel, which specializes in all sorts of combat sports, including wrestling. He also asked the fans to help him record the [intro for the TV broadcast][tv-intro]. The first event to be shown on FightBox was indeed Arena 23, but not until April 2024. The event was broadcast without commentary - while it was recorded, the TV station opted not to use it. KPW later [uploaded the main event to their YouTube channel][lato-vs-scorpion], with commentary in place. About half a year later Arena 23 aired on Extreme Sports Channel, this time with full commentary by Krystian Czekaj.
