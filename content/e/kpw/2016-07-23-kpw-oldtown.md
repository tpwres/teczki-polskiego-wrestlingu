[OldTown Festival][oldtown] is an annual LARP event, that bills itself as the largest post-apocalyptica LARP in Europe. It was held annually since 2005 at the grounds of former Soviet era [military airfield][airfield-wiki] in Kluczewo, near Stargard in West Pomerania. While the event and community is still active, the 2022 and 2023 editions were cancelled. Instead of the latter one, a [meetup][oldtown-meetup] was held during [Pyrkon][pyrkon] 2023.
The event's name is derived from the town of Stargard, which literally translates as Old Town.

KPW held a wrestling exhibition during the event on the penultimate day. Wrestling fits the post-apocalyptic theme of OldTown, however no special storylines were devised for the show. KPW would return to following editions of OldTown until 2019.

#### Recap

- Lambert attacked [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) before the opening bell, then left the ring to find a chair and kendo stick. The arsenal used was even wider - lighting tubes, a ladder and a baseball bat. The bleeding Lambert powerbombed Kaszub onto a large lighting tube to win.
- [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) countered Korpo's Deadline into a pin.
- People cheer Kawaler during his entrance, as he's billed from the nearby area, only to
  turn on him once he calls them dirty and smelly, and the festival a place of filth. Kawaler dominates, first punishing [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md), then Robert. Bianca performs a stinkface on Kawaler to great reactions. Oliwa enters to even the odds, but gets a low blow while his team was distracted.
