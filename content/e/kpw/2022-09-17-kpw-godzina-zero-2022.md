2022's Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_), the flagship supershow of the year, was unusually held in September, not August. It was the first Godzina Zero to be held since 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As was now the tradition, the show had multiple foreign guests, and featured all current champions defending their titles. This year, the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match was replaced with a 15-man battle royal, for the same contract to challenge for any of the titles.

The foreign guests for the event were:

- Scottish wrestler Tom Fulton
- Slovakian wrestler Ricky Sky
- German tag team Die Ordnung: Veit Müller and Hans Schulte
- Austrian wrestler Alex Berkner
- British wrestler Primate, but without his tag team partner Wild Boar, who was the co-holder of KPW's Tag Team Championship at the time. Instead, he was replaced by another British wrestler Tommy Freeman.

#### Build-up

* The KPW Championship belt was vacated in 2021 when current champion [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) left KPW to join PTW. Arenas 18 and 19 held matches between four wrestlers selected by Chairman Krystian Malinowski. The final 2 would face each other on this event.
* In a [facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/events/393729466203534/?post_id=412536367656177), KPW announced that Wild Boar, one half of current KPW Tag Team Champions, is unable to attend due to injury. As a result, the championship was officially vacated, and his replacement was to be revealed soon.

#### Recap

* Three Stages of Hell was a best 2 out of 3 falls match, but with stipulations changing after each pinfall. The stipulations were chosen at random by Chairman Krystian Malinowski. This resulted in the opening as a Submission Match, followed by a Texas Chain Match, and finally a Hardcore Match.
* Rosetti was quick to cash in his title opportunity on the badly beaten and tired David Oliwa, and grabbed the second belt for his faction
