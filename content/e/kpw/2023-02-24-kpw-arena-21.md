Stara Szkoła (_Old School_) was the 21st Arena event, held on February 24, 2023 in the [Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) club.

The event had one new foreign guest: Japanese wrestler Shigehiro Irie, by that time already a veteran of 12 years in the ring and over a thousand matches. Irie has been touring the European scene since 2018, appearing in almost all the independent wrestling companies. On this event, he would have his only match in Poland so far.

#### Build-up

* [Chemik's promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPeh98qc6YA) starts by imitating the communist-era news show Dziennik Telewizyjny (_Television Journal_), complete with theme tune. He appears in a suit and thick glasses and from a piece of paper reads a statement that clearly references the 1981 [Martial Law announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MHPrdAbse0).
* In Greg's first title defense since he won the title at Godzina Zero 2022, he faces the veteran Irie.

#### Recap

* Chemik was unable to score a win, and must keep his celibacy. Since taking his vow at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17-odrodzenie.md),
he scored one singles win against Piotr Opolski at [Arena 18](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md),
and one as a team with Lesak at the [Tattoo Konwent](@/e/kpw/2022-07-30-kpw-tattoo-konwent-2022-day1.md).
* Rosetti managed to keep his belt in a double countout when the fight spilled outside the ring, a decision that left many fans puzzled. As a champion, he hasn't scored a single win defending the belt.
* The German tag team managed to hold on to their championship. Post-match, they kept punishing their opponents, who were saved by Michał Fux. Then Chemik arrived and sided with the Germans. Then we saw a surprise return of the British Bouncer Club (Dom Taylor and Lee Rogers), who initially confronted the heels, but it didn't take them long to join the trio and attack Michał, Leon and Zefir. A brutal beatdown ensued, which included each of the faces being painfully thrown into thumbtacks.
* David Oliwa was dead set on pruning the Gregorian Branch after dispatching Chemik on the previous event. Lesak also had no chances against his more experienced rival.
