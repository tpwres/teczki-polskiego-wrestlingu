### Recap
* Greg vs Oliwa ended in a draw, with one wrestler tapping out and the other being counted out at the same time.
* Malinowski's list of suspects in the case of the attack on his life included [the Fux Brothers](@/tt/bracia-fux.md), [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), [Greg](@/w/greg.md), [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), [Triple H][tryplak], the audience and [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md).
* [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) chained [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) to a ring post and casually waited in a corner for his opponent to be counted out. Tomczak was later freed by a KPW crew member, only to attack him for his trouble.
* His victory earned Leon Lato a title shot for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) at Godzina Zero 2025, as [announced by Krystian Malinowski][leon-ot] prior to the show.
