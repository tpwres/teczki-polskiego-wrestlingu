Świeża Krew (_Fresh Blood_) was the 15th Arena show by [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), held at Gdynia Sports Center on November 16, 2019. The event's name refers to new wrestlers debuting in their solo fights: Daniel Boza and [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) (although the two appeared in the Magnificent Seven ladder match before).

#### Build-up

* Originally, [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) was to face [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md). However, on the day of the event, KPW posted on facebook that Moloch was injured, and cannot appear. Chemik's new opponent would be revealed during the event.
* [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) lost his career at the previous Godzina Zero event to [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md). He would no longer wrestle for KPW, remaining active as trainer and owner of the organization. In August, after Godzina Zero, he left for Romania as a trainer, and appear in two matches there.
* Previously [Greg](@/w/greg.md) took on a new persona of self-proclaimed Pope of Polish Wrestling, Pijus I Greg. [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) now also ditched his butler persona, and appears dressed like an altar boy.
* Now fully turned heel, with new gear and entrance music, [Boski 2.0](@/w/ostrowski.md) has a score to settle with [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md).
* Tag Team Champions [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) began to lose trust in each other.
