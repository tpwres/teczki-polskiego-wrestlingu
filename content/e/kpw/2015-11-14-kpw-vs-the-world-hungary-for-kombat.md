KPW vs the World was the first event held by the newly created KPW, on November 14, 2015, in the gymnastics hall of Gimnazjum 8 in Gdańsk. This was the same venue that hosted [DDW](@/o/ddw.md)'s [final event](@/e/ddw/2015-05-02-ddw-house-show-2.md). The show's poster also advertised showcases of judo and capoeira to accompany wrestling.

Most matches were between one wrestler from KPW and one from HCW, a Hungarian wrestling promotion that DDW used to cooperate with. This cooperation continued in the following years, and in particular [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) would become a familiar face in KPW. The Nations Cup concept on this event had each country score one point for a victory, across 5 matches so that a tie was not possible.
