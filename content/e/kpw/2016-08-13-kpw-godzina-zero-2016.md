Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_) is KPW's biggest event each year. Always held in August, and usually on the second Saturday (later Friday) of that month. KPW usually also holds their training camp just before that date. The first event was held in 2016, but the 2020 and 2021 editions were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2016 event featured Finnish female wrestler Aurora Flame in one of her last appearances before retiring. Also present were two British wrestlers from Kamikaze Pro, and Mika The Polish Punisher, a wrestler of Polish origin but performing on the British scene at the time.

The venue for this event was the Hall of Sports in Gdynia, which would become the primary venue for KPW between 2017 and 2021. While later events would have steel barriers between the ring area and audience, none are present here.

#### Build-up to the event

* This was Mika's first KPW appearance. The original plan was for him to make his debut at [KPW OldTown](@/e/kpw/2016-07-23-kpw-oldtown.md) in the tournament brackets.
* Kamil Aleksander defeated Piękny Kawaler for the #1 Contendership at the first [Arena show](@/e/kpw/2016-02-27-kpw-arena-1.md) in February
* Robert Star was the next one to win a title shot at [Arena 2](@/e/kpw/2016-04-30-kpw-arena-2.md) in a ladder match
* However, he lost it to Kawaler at [Arena 3](@/e/kpw/2016-06-11-kpw-arena-3.md)

#### Recap

* Rosetti distracts Jordan, and Sawicki low blows him from behind
* Kawaler enters the ring with his entire stable Kawaleria (_Cavalry_) dressed in dark robes and holding flaming torches.
* After Kamil Aleksander scores the second pin to even the score, Kawaleria tries to interfere, but Kaszub and Robert Star come into the ring area and start fighting. Then Rosetti and Sawicki arrive and attack them. The rest of the locker room follows, and a huge brawl breaks out. Referee unsuccessfully tries to throw them out, later threatening to stop the match, aand to disqualify Kawaler.
