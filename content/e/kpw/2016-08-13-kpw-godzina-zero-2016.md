Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_) is KPW's biggest event each year. Always held in August, and usually on the second Saturday (later Friday) of that month. KPW usually also holds their training camp just before that date. The first event was held in 2016, but the 2020 and 2021 editions were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2016 event featured Finnish female wrestler Aurora Flame in one of her last appearances before retiring. Also present were two British wrestlers from Kamikaze Pro, and Mika The Polish Punisher, a wrestler of Polish origin but performing on the British scene at the time.

The venue for this event was the Hall of Sports in Gdynia, which would become the primary venue for KPW between 2017 and 2021. While later events would have steel barriers between the ring area and audience, none are present here.

## Build-up

* This was Mika's first KPW appearance. The original plan was for him to make his debut at [KPW OldTown](@/e/kpw/2016-07-23-kpw-oldtown.md) in the tournament brackets.
* [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) defeated [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) for the #1 Contendership at the first [Arena show](@/e/kpw/2016-02-27-kpw-arena-1.md) in February
* [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) was the next one to win a title shot at [Arena 2](@/e/kpw/2016-04-30-kpw-arena-2.md) in a ladder match
* However, he lost it to Kawaler at [Arena 3](@/e/kpw/2016-06-11-kpw-arena-3.md)

### Recap

* [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) distracts Jordan, and [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) low blows him from behind
* Kawaler enters the ring with his entire stable Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_) dressed in dark robes and holding flaming torches.
* After [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) scored the second pin to even the score, Kawaleria tried to interfere, but [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) and [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) came into the ring and stopped them.
* Then [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) and [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) arrived to even the odds. The rest of the locker room followed, and a huge brawl broke out. Referee unsuccessfully tried to throw them out, later threatening to stop the match, and to disqualify Kawaler.
* After Robert Star lost to Jon Ryan, a young child in the audience was visibly upset. The crowd started chanting "Pociesz dziecko!" (_Comfort the child!_), prompting Star to give the boy his aviator glasses. (Sitting in front of the boy is young [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), who would join the KPW school around a year later.)
