Świąteczna Awantura (_A Christmas Brawl_) was the 20th Arena show, held just before Christmas 2022, on December 16th. The poster for this event imitated the movie poster for Home Alone, with ring announcer Kinga replicating the famous frightened appearance of the main character, the window-like background featuring faces of the villains, and even the choice of fonts. A slogan on the top of the poster, which in the original read "A family comedy without the family", now reads:

<strong>PREZENTY KUPIONE, CHOINKA UBRANA, JESZCZE TYLKO W\*\*\*\*\* I ŚWIĘTA</strong>

This translates to _Gifts bought, tree decorated, only need a beating and it's Christmas_. The censored word is _wpierdol_, an expletive term for the act of beating someone.

The Christmas-style was also used in promotional material, especially social media posts.

#### Build-up

* In a [promo][promo-1-kawaler-kinga], Piękny Kawaler and Kinga observe Rosetti, shoveling snow, through a window. Kawaler tells Kinga about how Rosetti is known as the Sadist from Łódź, and reminisces about Rosetti's former partner [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) and the events of [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md). When Rosetti notices them, they quickly roll down the curtains and hide from sight. \
This is a reference to the scene from Home Aloe where Kevin's brother Buzz and cousin Rod watch Marley through the window, shoveling snow and salting the sidewalk. Buzz tells them the rumors about Marley, that he's the South Bend Shovel Slayer. When Marley looked in their direction, the trio quickly hid behind the curtains.
* Die Ordnung delivered their [promo in German][promo-5-ordnung]. They talked about how the best tag team in Poland is from Germany, just like the best workplaces or the best cars, pointing to a Mercedes car behind them. Hans warned the Fux brothers that should they come to their house looking for the belts, the only one they will receive is a beating with his own belt, which he pulls out of his pants.
* In [their promo][promo-2-wet-bandits], Filip and Michał Fux, dressed in long dark coats and skull caps, crowbar in hand, break in to Die Ordnung's house, and ransack it looking for the tag team belts. They examine various items, laughing maniacally, but fail to find the championship belt. They leave the tap running after exiting the house, and returning to the car, talk about the running water being their calling card, and themselves the Wet Bandits. \
This is yet another reference to the movie - Marv and Harry, who tried to break into Kevin's house used the same calling card, named themselves the Wet Bandits.
* [Chemik's promo][promo-3-chemik] has him dressed in a suit and sitting in front of a Christmas tree and fireplace, eating pierogi, and addressing David Oliwa, talking about how he seems to have no friends. The video is black and white.
* Leon Lato [talks][promo-4-lato] about being happy to receive a special gift this Christmas: a singles match against the KPW Champion Greg. He mentions the odds in his favour being like that of Saudi Arabia winning with Argentina in the FIFA cup. During this segment floating, smiling faces of Aleksander Kwaśniewski and Robert Makłowicz are shown. His victory over Greg is to be the Christmas surprise. \
The floating faces also refer to the movie - the "I made My Family Disappear" scene. When the now alone Kevin reminisces about his family mistreating him, faces of his siblings float around.
* The event opened with a short video remaking a scene from Home Alone: Kinga sits on a living room couch, eating ice cream and watching a gangster film (with Chairman Krystian Malinowski playing a crime boss and Chemik appearing as a gangstger). The official KPW YouTube channel called this segment ["Angels with Wrestling Souls"][angels] - a direct reference to Home Alone's "Angels With Filthy Souls".

#### Recap

* Chemik still has only one victory, from the three he vowed to score. Therefore he must remain celibate.
* The original card also had Greg against Leon Lato, in a non-title match. Greg, however, was absent.
* Rosetti declined to defend his title, reportedly due to poor health. The bell rang, Rosetti immediately exited the ring and was counted out, which allowed him to keep the championship.
* An unhappy Darius issued an open challenge, which was answered by Leon Lato, also without a match.
* After the main event, the heel champions continued to attack their opponents, who were ultimately saved by Zefir, wielding a snow shovel, and Leon Lato. Chairman Krystian Malinowski arrived and announced a title defense against Zefir and Lato for the next event.
* After the second match a Christmas lottery was held. Every wristband given to fans at entrance had a three-digit number printed on it. Chairman Malinowski, wearing a Santa hat, came to the ring and drew three random numbers, selecting three winners who received gift boxes wrapped in Chrismas paper. Once all three winners stood in the ring with their prizes, Chemik appeared, berated Malinowski for letting "some three bums" into the "sacred place" and proceeded to insult all three. Malinowski, fed up with Chemik's behaviour, told him off and asked the audience to "use a certain word" to tell Chemik to go away.
