Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_) 2023 was KPW's sixth annual supershow, held since 2016. It also returned the show to its usual date in the middle of August, rather than September like the 2022 edition. The event took place in [Klub Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md), like all recent KPW shows.

The event had two new foreign guests: Welsh powerhouse Iestyn Rees, and German wrestler Ludy Lohan. Returning were: Italian masked wrestler Red Scorpion, the regular Fynn Freyhart, and KPW Tag Team Champions Die Ordnung: Veit Müller and Hans Schulte, all from Germany.

All three championships were defended and two changed hands. The Magnificent Seven Ladder Match was replaced by a Championship Contract Battle Royal, same as on the [2022 event](@/e/kpw/2022-09-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2022.md).

## Build-up

* Real Man Chemik, since winning his third match at the last event, has grown some serious mustache. In [his promo][chemik-promo], he explains that to be a man, you have to both look and act the part. At [Pyrkon](@/e/kpw/2023-06-17-kpw-pyrkon-2023.md), Leon eliminated Chemik who was mistakenly hit in the head with a chair by his own bodyguard. Chemik wants to show Leon what that feels like, in a Chairs Match.
* KPW's two high flyers Zefir and Fynn Freyhart will face each other. The prize - a shot at the OldTown championship.
* Die Ordnung won the championship belts at the previous year's Godzina Zero, in a four-way elimination match. Filip and Michał Fux were the last to be eliminated. Now they aim for the championship again, in their third match against the Germans.
* In [his vignette][rosetti-vignette], Rosetti cashed in his [Chairman's Briefcase](@/e/kpw/2023-05-19-kpw-arena-22.md) match. Coming to the Chairman's office, he presents his match, which Malinowski accepts.

### Recap

* This was the last event to feature the original OldTown championship belt. From [Arena 23](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md) onwards, it was replaced by a more conventional leather plate design.
* In the Battle Royal finale, Leon Lato faced Chemik again, after being defeated in their singles match.
* Greg's appearance for the main event was preceeded by a body double wearing Greg's usual brown monk's robe, entering the ring to a different music. A short while later Greg's usual theme song hit and the champion made his entrance wearing new all-white robes.
* David was carried out from the ring on a stretcher. His defeat at this event started his losing streak and eventual heel turn.
* While Red Scorpion celebrated his victory, Leon Lato arrived in the ring, holding the Championship contract he just won, and challenged Scorpion for the championship at the next event.
* In a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/kpwrestling/posts/pfbid02UQY6HWgyVoCpq9RayytozE7D7UNcAfFCGYVceD1FKZY4LrpyhUwHtTaCAywLahQfl), KPW stated that Godzina Zero 2023 was their 40th overall event, since the promotion started in 2015.
