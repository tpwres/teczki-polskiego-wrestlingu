The second Arena event, held on Saturday, April 30, 2016, was a return to Gdańsk, and the same venue that held DDW's final shows and KPW's [inaugural event](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md).

[Kawaler's](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) heel faction [Kawaleria](@/tt/kawaleria.md) dominated the show. There was one foreign wrestler invited to perform: [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) from Hungary, already a familiar face from the DDW days. This was also the debut of two new characters: [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md), who quickly became popular with the fans, and [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md), the future [KPW Tag Team Champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) with [Victor Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md).

### Recap

- During a ringside altercation between Zasada and [Mira](@/w/mira.md), Korpo is hit with a briefcase to the head, later wants to hit Zasada with a Deadline, but only pushes him away.
  Fans cheer the mistreated manager.
- Lambert was to face [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), who got suspended after Kawaler revealed some controversial information. Cuts a promo belittling the entire locker room,
  and asks for a new opponent to face. [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md) debuts with his "Hańba!" (_Dishonor!_) catchphrase to great reactions.
- Corvus dominates early, but Kawaler's faction intervenes and draws him backstage. Reappears beaten up, and Kawaler takes control of the match.
- KPW's first ladder match ever with forming temporary tag teams. Robert bleeds from a ladder hit, while Kawaler intervenes and denies [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) the win. Robert drops him
  from the top of the ladder with a Rockstar Hangover, then climbs it and grabs the contract.
