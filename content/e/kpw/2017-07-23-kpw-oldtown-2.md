[OldTown Festival][oldtown] is an annual LARP event, that bills itself as the largest post-apocalyptica LARP in Europe. It was held since 2005 at the grounds of former Soviet era [military airfield in Kluczewo](@/v/stargard-lotnisko-kluczewo.md), near Stargard in West Pomerania. While the community is still active, the 2022 and 2023 editions were cancelled. Instead of the latter one, a [meetup][oldtown-meetup] was held during [Pyrkon][pyrkon] 2023, and since 2024, Pyrkon's post-apocalyptic cosplay event largely replaced it.
The event's name is derived from the town of Stargard, which literally translates as Old Town.

KPW held a wrestling exhibition during the event's last day. Wrestling fits the post-apocalyptic theme of OldTown. The second OldTown is also where KPW's midcard belt, appropriately named "[KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md)", was created and the inaugural championship crowned. The OldTown Championship belt had a unique look, matching the event's post-apocalyptic theme. The original strap was retired at [KPW Arena 23](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md) and replaced with a more traditionally designed version.

KPW would return to following editions of OldTown until 2019.

### Recap

- Like at the [previous event](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7.md), [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) was on the poster, but not on the card.
- Due to heavy rain, the show was delayed for four hours, until midnight.
- The original card had more matches, and a tournament was to be held. The starting brackets were:
  - [Peter Pannache](@/w/peter-pannache.md) vs [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md)
  - [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) vs [Victor Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md)
  - [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) vs [Greg](@/w/greg.md)
  - [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) vs Mika The Polish Punisher
- Aside from that, there was a three-way fight scheduled between [Mateusz Kowalski](@/w/mateusz-kakareko.md), [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md) and [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md); plus the hardcore match between [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) and Corvus.
- The final two participants of the opening rumble face each other for the KPW OldTown championship in the main event.
- Kawaler appears, declares he's had enough of OldTown and will not take part, only to soon change his mind.
- Corvus powerbombed [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) into a table stacked with lighting tubes to win.
