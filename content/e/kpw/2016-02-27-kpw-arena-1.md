The first of KPW's regular Arena shows was held on February 27, 2016, in Trąbki Wielkie, a village about 20km south of Gdańsk. A local school's gymnastics hall was the venue.

In 2016, a total of four Arena shows were held: three in the first half of the year, and one in November. This pattern became KPW's regular show cadence, adding the supershow Godzina Zero in the middle of August. It was mostly upheld until 2019, completely paused in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resuming in 2022. Since 2017, shows at OldTown and later Pyrkon replaced the Arena show held in June.
