"Nowe Porządki" (_A New Order_) was a show by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).

#### Build-up

* On 6.01.2025 KPW released a [video][boss-rosetti], in which acting chairman [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) announced that [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) "has vanished from the face of the Earth", so he's taking matters into his own hands for the good of KPW.
* Rosetti then stated that the upcoming event would see many changes, the continuation of the tournament started at [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) and the debut of a Polish wrestler.
* This wrestler was later revealed to be Tomczak, one of KPW dojo trainees. As an unnamed "Bodyguard", he already stepped into the ring at [Pyrkon 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-06-17-kpw-pyrkon-2023.md), teaming with [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) against the Fux Brothers. His [vignette][tomczak-intro] strongly resembles [Moloch's](@/w/moloch.md), and the character is also portrayed as a tall, mask-wearing monster.
* Initially this event was supposed to see the tournament semi-finals, however since only three people qualified, acting chairman Rosetti [decided][rosetti-finals] that the finalist would be determined in a three-way match.

#### Recap

- The show opened with [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) coming out to the ring and announcing that, as promised, there would be some changes. To start with, out of concern for the safety of the fans, [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) was banned from making his usual fire-breathing entrance. 
- According to Rosetti, the federation listens to the fans and thus changes to accomodate their wishes. Since the fans [often chant](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md) "sędzia chuj" (_referee is a dick_), Rosetti decided to relegate [Krystian Czekaj](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md) to the role of a technical referee and give the main referee duty over to [Kinga Miotke](@/w/kinga-miotke.md).
- Next, Rosetti announced the return of the "prodigal son" - [Piotr Opolski](@/w/piotr-opolski.md), last seen at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md). Opol would replace Kinga as the ring announcer.
- At one point in his fight, Callum Beck turned Zefir's masked front-to-back, _Exorcist_-style.
- Greg vs Tomczak was originally announced as a Handicap Match, with Rosetti teaming up with the debutant. However, Rosetti stated that he didn't realise putting a show together requires qutie so much work, therefore the match would be a Singles Match instead, with Rosetti closely observing the action from ringside to make sure it's a fair fight.
- The fight started out normally, although Greg - dwarfed by the monster Tomczak - quickly started receiving babyface pop. After severeal minutes both wrestlers were outside of the ring, being counted by Kinga. Rosetti then announced that from this moment on, there would be no count-outs in this fight.
- A few minutes later Rosetti gave Tomczak a kendo stick and stated that this was now a no-DQ match.
- Later still, Rosetti decided he was fed up with Kinga's refereeing and inserted himself as a Special Guest Referee.
- After the main event, Chemik cut a promo hyping himself up as the best champion in KPW. Suddently Filip Fux came out and challenged Chemik for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), which Chemik refused. Filip then proceeded to list a number of reasons why Chemik is always the second best, finally enraging the champion by calling him "his own girlfriend's second favourite wrestler". The situation was eventually diffused by Rosetti coming out of the backstage to announce a Street Fight between the two at the next show.
- Present in the audience was [Arek Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) wearing a [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) T-shirt.
- Present on the backstage was [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md), last seen in the ring at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md).
