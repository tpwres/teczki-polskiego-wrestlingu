"Nowe Porządki" (_A New Order_) is an upcoming show by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).

#### Build-up

* On 6.01.2025 KPW released a [video][boss-rosetti], in which acting chairman [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) announced that [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) "has vanished from the face of the Earth", so he's taking matters into his own hands for the good of KPW.
* Rosetti then stated that the upcoming event would see many changes, the continuation of the tournament started at [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) and the debut of a Polish wrestler.
* Initially this event was supposed to see the tournament semi-finals, however since only three people qualified, acting chairman Rosetti [decided][rosetti-finals] that the finalist will be determined in a three-way match.
