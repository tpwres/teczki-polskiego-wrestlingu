Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_) 2025 was the eighth annual KPW supershow, held since 2016. Like most previous editions, GZ'25 was be held in August, and returned to [Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) after the [last year's edition](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md) took place at a gym hall at Stefana Okrzei 6 street.

## Build-up

* At [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md) [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) defeated [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md), earning a title shot for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) at Godzina Zero 2025.
* Likewise, at the same show, [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) earned his title shot for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) by defeating [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md).
* On 18.07.2025 KPW released a [video][młodzi-wilcy] in which a group of 13 rookies addressed [chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md), stating they're fed up with being bullied by [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) and demanding a match against him. The group included [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md), the rookie manhandled by Tomczak at [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md), and three women, hinting at the first match to include female talent in [five years](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md).
* On 23.07.2025 [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) [replied][malinowski-odpowiada], saying that the idea of rookies facing Tomczak is so absurd he's willing to agree. However, he stated that only three of the "rebels" will get to do the honours and that the lucky ones will be decided in a battle royal to be held "in a moment".
* Two days later KPW posted a [video][zwyciezka-trojka] of the battle royal, with the three winners being congratulated - but also warned - by [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md).
* On 2.08.2025 [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) vs Lato for the KPW OldTown Championship was officially confirmed.
* The next day KPW confirmed the match between [Bracia Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md) ([Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) & [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md)) and [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md) ([Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) & [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md)) for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). This match was brought about by a situation at [Pyrkon 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-06-14-kpw-pyrkon-2025.md), where Team Visegrad attacked Filip and Michał after the brothers won their bout against [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md).
* The main event - [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) vs [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) - was officially confirmed on 11.08.2025.
* The Handicap Match between [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) and three as-yet unnamed rookies was confirmed two days later.
* On 15.08.2025 KPW announced [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) vs Crowchester, who was last seen at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md).
* On 18.08.2025 [Greg](@/w/greg.md) vs [Lukáš Mottl](@/w/skull-evil.md) was announced. Mottl made his KPW debut at [Pyrkon](@/e/kpw/2025-06-14-kpw-pyrkon-2025.md) earlier that year, but this will be his first mainline KPW show. Previously, he'd made a number of appearances (as Skull Evil) for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) and one for [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md).
* The following day saw the announcement of debutant Markus Paskal, a graduate of the KPW Academy, vs [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md).
* Lastly, on 20.08.2025, KPW announced a 13-Man Championship Contract Battle Royal. This replaces the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match, a staple of most Godzina Zero shows held in previous years.
* On the day before the show, KPW released a [video][motywacja-oliwy] in which David Oliwa addressed [Filip & Michał Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md), stating that because they took away his chance at the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) at [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), he will now take what's most important to them: their [KPW Tag Team Championships](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) then added (in Slovak) that it won't be just their titles, but also their fans, their joy and their name: they'll no longer be (in English) "Fux Brothers", but rather (in Polish) "Shit Brothers".

### Highlights

* [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) sustained an injury during the match, which forced him to leave [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) to fend for himself. Later in the match he came back with bandaged left hand to aid his brother in the fight.
* When Michał pinned [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md), [Lukáš Mottl](@/w/skull-evil.md) came out of the backstage and placed Ricky's leg on the bottom rope, forcing a break.
* After winning the second match, [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md) extended his hand to Markus Paskal and hugged him, only to then attack him.
* Present in the audience were Markus Paskal's mother and friends, who prepared a large banner to cheer him on. After the fight, Paskal cut a brief promo thanking the fans for giving him a chance to prove himself and apologising for wasting that chance. He ended by thanking his mother, prompting the crowd to chant "Mum!"
* Upon entering the ring, [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) tore down Paskal's banner.
* Crowchester came out to heel heat, unlike during his previous appearance at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md). During the course of the match, however, the audience began to cheer for him.
* The fight between [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) briefly moved out of the ring and near the merch stand. Leon took the opportunity to grab a handful of Chemik's postcards and whack him on the head with them, before giving the cards to the fans.
* The three rookies facing [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) weren't named. The crowd quickly took to calling them "Rookie One", "Rookie Two" and "Rookie Three" (_Adept Jeden_, _Adept Dwa_ and _Adept Trzy_).
* Before the match started, [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) came out and cut a brief promo berating the rookies for rebelling against Tomczak, which in Malinowski's eyes means rebelling against himself and KPW. He then told Tomczak to teach the rookies a lesson they wouldn't forget.
* Lukáš Mottl tried cheating by removing the padding from a turnbuckle, only to hit it head-first himself.
* The elimination order during the Battle Royal was as follows:
  - Crowchester
  - [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md)
  - [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md)
  - [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md)
  - [Greg](@/w/greg.md)
  - [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md)
  - [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md)
  - [Lukáš Mottl](@/w/skull-evil.md)
  - [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md)
  - [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md)
  - [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md)
  - Leon Lato
  - [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md)
  - Markus Paskal
* After being eliminated, Tomczak returned to the ring and threw Leon Lato out; the referee declared Leon's elimination null and void, and Lato soon returned to the ring to continue the match.
* After being thrown out and landing next to some fans, [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) untied their shoelaces.
* At one point near the end of the match [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) landed outside the ring. He was not declared eliminated by ring announcer [Kinga](@/w/kinga-miotke.md), however, suggesting he didn't go over the top rope. As Markus Paskal was celebrating his apparent victory, Lesak came back to the ring and threw him out, winning the Battle Royal himself.
* Some of the eliminated wrestlers were offered beer by Istotna Martynka from Istota Wrestlingu podcast.
* Prior to the main event, Krystian Malinowski came out again and cut a promo in which he claimed to have received an anonymous letter in the mail, whose author threatened him to leave [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) and [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) alone, lest he bitterly regrets it. Malinowski stated that although he didn't know who wrote it, he suspected it was Zefir, whom he then called a disease to which he himself was the cure. He also made a callback to [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md), saying he doesn't care if the letter was written by Zefir, Rosetti, Greg, [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md) or [Triple H][tryplak]. Lastly, he said he'd find and destroy the person responsible even if he had to enter a pact with "reptile people, reptilians, the Masons, or the Devil himself" (to which a couple of fans called "with [PTW](@/o/ptw.md)!" and "with [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md)!").
* Zefir faced some technical issues during his entrance, as his fire-breathing mixture wouldn't ignite until the third attempt.
* Zefir came out with a Polish flag. [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) later used it to blow his nose and floss his posterior, to great audience heat.
* After winnig the match and the Championship, Zefir gestured for a microphone and spoke for the very first time: "Hej Gdynia, zrobiłem to!" (_Hey Gdynia, I did it_!).
