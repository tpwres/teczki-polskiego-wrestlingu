Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_) 2025 is the upcoming eighth annual KPW supershow, held since 2016. Like most previous editions, GZ'25 will be held in August, and it will return to [Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) after the [last year's edition](@/e/kpw/2024-09-07-kpw-godzina-zero-2024.md) took place at a gym hall at Stefana Okrzei 6 street.

## Build-up

* At [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md) [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) defeated [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md), earning a title shot for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) at Godzina Zero 2025.
* Likewise, at the same show, [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) earned his title shot for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) by defeating [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md).
* On 18.07.2025 KPW released a [video][młodzi-wilcy] in which a group of 13 rookies addressed [chairman Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md), stating they're fed up with being bullied by [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) and demanding a match against him. The group included [Adam Wong](@/w/adam-wong.md), the rookie manhandled by Tomczak at [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md), and three women, hinting at the first match to include female talent in [five years](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md).
* On 23.07.2025 [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) [replied][malinowski-odpowiada], saying that the idea of rookies facing Tomczak is so absurd he's willing to agree. However, he stated that only three of the "rebels" will get to do the honours and that the lucky ones will be decided in a battle royal to be held "in a moment".
* Two days later KPW posted a [video][zwyciezka-trojka] of the battle royal, with the three winners being congratulated - but also warned - by [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md).
* On 2.08.2025 [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) vs Lato for the KPW OldTown Championship was officially confirmed.
* The next day KPW confirmed the match between [Bracia Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md) ([Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) & [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md)) and Team Visegrad ([Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) & [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md)) for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). This match was brought about by a situation at [Pyrkon 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-06-14-kpw-pyrkon-2025.md), where Team Visegrad attacked Filip and Michał after the brothers won their bout against [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md).
* The main event - [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) vs [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) - was officially confirmed on 11.08.2025.
* The Handicap Match between [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) and three as-yet unnamed rookies was confirmed two days later.
* On 15.08.2025 KPW announced [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) vs Crowchester, who was last seen at [Arena 17](@/e/kpw/2021-08-21-kpw-arena-17.md).
* On 18.08.2025 [Greg](@/w/greg.md) vs [Lukáš Mottl](@/w/skull-evil.md) was announced. Mottl made his KPW debut at [Pyrkon](@/e/kpw/2025-06-14-kpw-pyrkon-2025.md) earlier that year, but this will be his first mainline KPW show. Previously, he'd made a number of appearances (as Skull Evil) for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) and one for [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md).
* The following day saw the announcement of debutant Markus Paskal, a graduate of the KPW Academy, vs [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md).
* Lastly, on 20.08.2025, KPW announced a 13-Man Championship Contract Battle Royal. This replaces the Magnificent Seven Ladder Match, a staple of most Godzina Zero shows held in previous years.
* On the day before the show, KPW released a [video][motywacja-oliwy] in which David Oliwa addressed [Filip & Michał Fux](@/tt/bracia-fux.md), stating that because they took away his chance at the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) at [Arena 27](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), he will now take what's most important to them: their [KPW Tag Team Championships](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md). [Ricky Sky](@/w/ricky-sky.md) then added (in Slovak) that it won't be just their titles, but also their fans, their joy and their name: they'll no longer be (in English) "Fux Brothers", but rather (in Polish) "Shit Brothers".
