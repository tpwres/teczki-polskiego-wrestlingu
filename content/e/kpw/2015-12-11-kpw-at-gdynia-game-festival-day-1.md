Gdynia Game Festival was primarily an e-sports event, accompanied by robotics workshops, several talks about modern technologies, and even cosplay shows, held in 2015. While there were plans for follow-up editions, ultimately only one was ever held.

KPW held exhibition shows on all three days of the festival, from Friday 11th to Sunday 13th December 2015. Their ring was reused for other events, including robotic combat.
In the following years, KPW was a guest to more fan conventions and festivals like this: [OldTown](@/e/kpw/2016-07-23-kpw-oldtown.md) between 2016 and 2019, [Szlamfest](@/e/kpw/2017-02-04-kpw-szlamfest.md) from 2017 to 2019, and [Pyrkon][pyrkon] in 2022 and 2023.
