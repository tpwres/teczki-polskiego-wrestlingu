[OldTown Festival][oldtown] is an annual LARP event, that bills itself as the largest post-apocalyptica LARP in Europe. It was held annually since 2005 at the grounds of former Soviet era [military airfield][airfield-wiki] in Kluczewo, near Stargard in West Pomerania. While the event and community is still active, the 2022 and 2023 editions were cancelled. Instead of the latter one, a [meetup][oldtown-meetup] was held during [Pyrkon][pyrkon] 2023.

In 2019, the event was held between July 8 and 13. Additionally, on the following weekend, July 20-21, non-participants could enter the airport grounds, for an open event with many attractions (including wrestling). KPW held two shows: one on the final day of the LARP part, and one during this open weekend. This page covers both days.

The foreign guests for this event were all from Germany: the experienced Lucas Robinson and two relatively new but estabilished wrestlers Crowchester and Matthias Bernstein. [Fynn Freyhart](@/w/fynn-freyhart.md) also returned to take on one half of the KPW Tag Team Champions.
