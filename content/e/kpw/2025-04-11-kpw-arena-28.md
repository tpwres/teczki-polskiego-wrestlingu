KPW Arena 28: Zły Omen (_Bad Omen_, or _Evil Omen_) was a show by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). This is the third Arena - after [Arena V](@/e/kpw/2017-01-14-kpw-arena-v.md) and [Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md) - to use a Roman numeral (albeit only on the poster, whereas the other two also used them in the names of their respective Facebook events).

This show featured two championship fights - a Street Fight between [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) for the [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), and [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) vs [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) (the winner of the #1 Contendership Tournament at the [previous show](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md)) for the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md).

#### Build-up

* On 4.04.2025 KPW [released a video][rosetti-zapowiada] in which the acting chairman [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) stated that the promotion needs a full-time leader, and since [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) still shows no signs of life, a new KPW chairman will be sworn in at the show (strongly implying himself; later officially confirmed).
* In the same video, Rosetti also announced the date of [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md).

#### Recap
* Like the [last time](@/e/kpw/2025-01-24-kpw-arena-27.md), the show was hosted by [Piotr Opolski](@/w/piotr-opolski.md) and refereed by [Kinga Miotke](@/w/kinga-miotke.md).
* Piotr Opolski came out to Kinga's usual theme song, "Stand or Fall" by Bonfire.
* As Piotr Opolski was opening the show, the crowd got seemingly bored with his speech and started booing him. After a while [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) came out of the backstage, took the microphone and in a few short words declared the show open.
* During his entrance and later during the fight, [Greg](@/w/greg.md) was getting a lot of babyface pop.
* [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) came out in new ring gear. At one point during the match Greg grabbed Eryk's singlet and pulled it down, exposing Lesak's posterior (much to fans' applause).
* [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) was still banned from using fire during his entry routine.
* It being a street fight, [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) and [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) fought in casual attire rather than their usual ring gear.
* Weapons used in the street fight included: several hubcaps, a traffic cone, a garbage bin and lid, a chair, a kendo stick, a [B-41 road sign][znaki-drogowe] "no entry for pedestrians", a scarf of [Arka Gdynia][arka-gdynia-dobrodziejka-wieprzowina], a baseball bat, a lenth of chain and a trousers belt.
* Filip bled profusely during the match leaving plenty of bloodstains on the club's hardwood floor, which proved harder to remove than the ring crew anticipated.
* Chemik and Filip stole each other's finishing moves.
* After winning the fight, Chemik cut a short promo stating that he never wanted to do this to Filip and blaming Rosetti (for booking the match), Filip (for wanting the fight), Kinga (for not stopping it) and the fans (for cheering).
* For the induction of Rosetti as the new chairman, every wrestler except [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) came out to the ring. Filip Fux stood alongside the heels (Chemik, Lesak and Tomczak), whereas Greg sided with the babyfaces (Zefir and Leon Lato).
* The induction ceremony, conducted by Piotr Opolski, was suddenly interrupted by the unexpected arrival of [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md). Malinowski stated that him asking Rosetti to take over the company happened "in Rosetti's dreams", and that he was disappointed in everybody for being so easily misled by one person.
* Malinowski then reverted Rosetti's decision from the previous show, stating that Zefir is once again allowed to use fire during his entrances from now on.
* Lastly, as a punishment for going behind his back, Malinowski ruled that Rosetti is no longer going to be a wrestler, but instead will be a new commentator.
* After winning his match against Michał Fux, [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) started kicking his defeated opponent, prompring a reaction from Zefir who jumped at him from the club's balcony, like he did at [Arena 18](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18.md).
* Krystian Malinowski then appeared again and teased Zefir vs Hans Schulte for the Championship title at [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md) to a great fan reaction - only to then say no and state that Zefir is a prime suspect for the attack on the chairman at [Arena 26](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md). Malinowski followed this by declaring that Zefir would have to defeat [Veit Müller](@/w/veit-mueller.md) (last seen at [Pyrkon 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-06-15-kpw-pyrkon-2024.md)) - if he succeeds, he'll get a title shot at Godzina Zero 2025, regardless of who the reigning champion will be.
