Teczka Prezesa (_The Chairman's Briefcase_) was the 22nd Arena show, held in [Klub Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) on May 19, 2023.

The event had one returning foreign guest: Lee Rogers, one half of the British Bouncer Club; and two new ones: the 24-year old German wrestler [Flexos](@/w/flexos.md), and British wrestler Zak Knight (a.k.a. Zak Zodiac).

## Build-up

* Chairman [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) addressed the tag team brawl that happened on the [previous show](@/e/kpw/2023-02-24-kpw-arena-21.md). To satisfy all the demands, two tournament matches will be held between the rivaling teams, with the winners to face current champions [Die Ordnung](@/tt/die-ordnung.md) at [Godzina Zero](@/w/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) in a three-way tag team match.

### Recap

* Before the main event, Chairman Krystian Malinowski walked into the ring holding the titular leather briefcase. According to him, this briefcase is an additional reward for whoever wins today's main event, but refused to elaborate what's inside. \
  Later, Chemik distracted the referee while Lesak entered the ring, and attacked Zak with the briefcase. Rosetti went for the pin, but Zak barely escaped the three count. After a spear from Zak, both exited the ring and briefly brawled on the entrance stage. Finally, Zak tapped out to an armbar. \
  Rosetti celebrated his victory in the ring with Lesak and Chemik, then received the briefcase from the ref. Inside, he found a clip pad with a contract allowing him to create a singles match of his chosen stipulation at the upcoming Godzina Zero, booking either himself or two other competitors.
* Before the show closed, Zak thanked the audience, and asked the management to allow him to come back and show how he makes his dreams come true in another match.
* For Chemik, this was his third win since swearing celibacy until he was able to win three matches. During the event a small [celebratory ceremony][ceremonia] was held. In order for Chemik to be pronounced "a real man", he had to complete three trials: down a small bottle of vodka in one go, smoke a cigarette and have sex with a woman of his choice. All the women in attendence were deemed unsatisfactory by him, however, so to mitigate, Greg made a phone call to an escort service in order to hire a call girl (complete with a screenshot of an actual escorting website being projected on the screen).
* After the event, Chemik [posted a promo][promo-chemika] where he lies on a bed barechested, cigarette in hand and very happy, with an unknown woman dressed in a typical Playboy-style fishnets and black lingerie behind him. He talked about how no one believed in him, proving that he is a real man, and how the real Chemik has just been born. This would signal a later change to his character.
