On 6.09.2025 KPW held an event in the village of [Kadzidło][kadzidlo], as part of the local [harvest festival][dozynki]. The event was not promoted on their usual social media channels. It was also the first time since [OldTown 4](@/e/kpw/2019-07-13-kpw-oldtown-4.md) back in 2019 that the organization held a show outside of the Tricity area, other than at [Pyrkon](@/e/kpw/2025-06-14-kpw-pyrkon-2025.md).

Match card unofficial, based on available pictures and videos.

### Highlights
* [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) came out wearing his [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), but it is unknown whether or not the match was for the title and if [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) cashed in his championship contract he won at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md).
* For [Tomczak](@/w/tomczak.md) vs The Rookies, which harkened back to their match from GZ'25, Rookie One was replaced by [Adam](@/w/adam-wong.md). He was the first to be eliminated by Tomczak.
* Like Zefir, [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) also came out wearing his [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) but again, it is unknown if the title was at stake.
* [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) did not appear at this show; instead, Filip teamed up with an Oskar Fux (repackaged Rookie One from GZ'25), wearing the same Fux trousers.
* Callum Beck hit Oskar Fux with a chair while the referee was distracted by Louis Basham, securing a victory.
* The three rookies managed to get their revenge on Tomczak by eliminating him with combined forces during the Battle Royal.
* While the audience seemed largely unfamiliar with pro wrestling, there were nonetheless some ["trzecia lina" chants](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#calls-to-action).
