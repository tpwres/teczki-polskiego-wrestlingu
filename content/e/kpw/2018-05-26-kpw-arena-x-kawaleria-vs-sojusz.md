#### Build-up

* Kawaleria vs Sojusz was built around the storyline of KPW's entire locker room being split in two factions: either
  the heel faction Kawaleria (_The Cavalry_) led by [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), or the face faction Sojusz (_The Alliance_), led by
  [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md).
* Initially, Robert hesitated to join, but after the post-event brawl at [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md), when he
  defended [Mira](@/w/mira.md) from being attacked with a taser by Kawaleria, everyone of the faces joined.
* Robert became #1 Contender for the KPW Championship at Arena 9, when [Greg](@/w/greg.md) lost by DQ. During this event, he would face the undefeated Kawaler for the championship.
* [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) won the Magnificent Seven Match at the previous year's [Godzina Zero](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), for a shot at any of the championships. At Arena 9, Corvus reminded [Greg](@/w/greg.md) that he's coming for his title.
* On Facebook, Kawaler announced that [Kaszub](@/w/kaszub.md) is discharged from his faction. He would never again appear for KPW, likely retiring from wrestling altogether.

#### Recap

- Two new girls in catsuits accompany [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md) to the ring. One of them will later make an in-ring debut as [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md). The other one is Laura, who later trained with [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) but never debuted.
- Ditching the old persona of Kowalski, [Mateusz Kakareko](@/w/mateusz-kowalski.md) became more aggressive, using a Taekwondo-based style, and broke his losing streak.
- Greg "christened" members of the Kawaleria stable by spitting water on them. This would later become part of his character.
- [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md)'s mother was present, and Kamil gave her a rose for Mother's Day (May 26th in Poland)
- Zasada was eliminated first, then [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md). With the balance now favouring Team Greg, [Adam Bravo](@/w/adam-bravo.md) pulls out a betrayal by laying down for a pin, showing his middle fingers to Kawaleria.
- Pannache eliminated [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), but ultimately Dawid had to face Greg and [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) alone.
- Kawaler delays the match with a very long entry in his new gear, preceded by a body double decoy in his previous attire. Greg would copy this years later during [Godzina Zero 2023](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md).
- [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) interrupted the opening bell with her music. Grabbed the mic to present a counter to Kawaler's blackmail photos: some of her own, depicting his private parties. These showed him and Greg in a naughty position, both wearing skirts. The audience laughed at the fuming, embarassed heels. Bianca forced both to swear an oath to never again try blackmailing her.
- Lumberjacks ensured that Kawaler couldn't flee the ring easily, as is his tactic. Same for Robert, who was also roughed up each time. Random group brawls ensued.
- Ref bump by Kawaler denies Robert a win by submission. Later, Kawaler hits a chairshot, but the ref is unable to count past two.
- Kawaler invites his butler [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) to start pouring out vodka, but [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md) interrupts.
- In the scramble, [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md) briefly fought [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md). They would have a proper fight on the next event.
- Corvus cleared the ring by piledriving members of Kawaleria one at a time. Kawaler is dragged into the ring by force. One powerbomb through a table later, we have a new KPW Champion, ending Kawaler's reign.
