KPW Arena 31: made in Poland is an upcoming show by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), set to take place the day before [WWE Road to Royal Rumble](@/e/wwe/2026-01-17-wwe-road-to-royal-rumble.md) - which the name of the show is a slight jab at.

Arena 31 was announced around 90 minutes after [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) unveiled [their show](@/e/ppw/2026-01-16-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie-hardcore-edition.md), also to take place in Gdynia on the same day.
