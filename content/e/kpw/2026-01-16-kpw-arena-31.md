KPW Arena 31: Made in Poland is an upcoming show by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md), set to take place the day before [WWE Road to Royal Rumble](@/e/wwe/2026-01-17-wwe-road-to-royal-rumble.md) - which the name of the show is a slight jab at.

Arena 31 was announced around 90 minutes after [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) unveiled [their show](@/e/ppw/2026-01-16-ppw-najlepsza-gala-w-miescie-hardcore-edition.md), also set to take place in Gdynia on the same day.

It is the third KPW Arena, following [Atlantic City](@/e/kpw/2017-01-14-kpw-arena-v.md) and [Capo Di Tutti Capi](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md), not to be named in Polish.

## Build-up

* The original poster for the show, featuring [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) with the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), was revealed on 3.11.2025. Fans voiced their concerns that the poster spoils the outcome of his match against [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) at [Arena XXX](@/e/kpw/2025-11-14-kpw-arena-xxx.md), and some of the wrestlers also expressed their opinions on the matter in their video promos prior to the show. Later, on 21.11, KPW published an updated version of the poster, this time featuring [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md), owing to Zefir's firing from KPW by Malinowski at the last event.
