KPW Arena XXX: Dekada (_The Decade_) was a show by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). It marks the 10th anniversary of the promotion - KPW's [first event](@/e/kpw/2015-11-14-kpw-vs-the-world-hungary-for-kombat.md) took place exactly 10 years prior, to the day.

This is the third KPW show, following [Arena V](@/e/kpw/2017-01-14-kpw-arena-v.md) and [Arena X](@/e/kpw/2018-05-26-kpw-arena-x.md), to use a Roman numeral.

## Build-up

* On 23.10.2025 KPW released a [video][malinowski-xxx] in which [Krystian Malinowski](@/w/krystian-malinowski.md) talked about the upcoming show. He started by saying that the 10th anniversary of KPW will be celebrated by the promotion's full roster and the fans. Next, he stated that this time around the match card will not be announced in advance of the event, as he himself doesn't know it. Instead, the federation decided to bet on "absolute freedom and spontaneity" - the match-ups will be decided by the wrestlers themselves during the show. There was only one fight Malinowski decided to announce the next day, as he deemed it worthy of the 10th anniversary.
* The next day saw the announcement of [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) vs [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) in a [belt](@/c/kpw-championship.md) vs [belt](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) Winner Takes All Match.
* Over the week leading to the event, KPW released a series of video promos by some of the wrestlers:
  - 5.11: [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) talked in [his video][lesak-narzeka] about the poster for [Arena 31](@/e/kpw/2026-01-16-kpw-arena-31.md) having [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md) with the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md) on it, which Lesak thought would be outdated by the end of Arena XXX.
  - 9.11: [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) [did as well][leon-tez-narzeka].
  - 10.11: [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) [said][filip-chce-pasa] he'd like a rematch with [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md) against [Team Visegrad](@/tt/team-visegrad.md) for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md), as he considered Visegrad's victory not clean.
  - 11.11: Miserable-looking [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) said that "something sad" is going to happen at the show.
  - 12.11: [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) [advised][nieoczekiwany-hans] the fans to "expect the unexpected".

### Recap
* [Kinga Miotke](@/w/kinga-miotke.md) opened the show and introduced [Zefir](@/w/zefir.md), who came out and cut a lengthy promo stating that after proving himself and winning the [KPW Championship](@/c/kpw-championship.md), he now has something to say and that he intends for his name to be forever associated with the title.
* [Leon Lato](@/w/leon-lato.md) then came out to the ring and told Zefir "to his face… or rather, to his mask" that their fight had nothing to do with their friendship, but rather it was about proving who's the best. He then told Zefir to be ready for him, to which Zefir answered that he was - and since Leon was as well, the two agreed to fight right away.
* [Krystian Czekaj](@/w/krystian-czekaj.md) was greeted with ["sędzia chuj"](@/a/polish-wrestling-chants.md#referee) chants as soon as Zefir asked him into the ring.
* During the match, Erik Asmus and Friedrich Pohlmann ([Die Ordnung 2.0](@/tt/die-ordnung.md) ran into the ring and attacked the contenders, causing the match to end in a DQ in Leon's favour. They were soon chased off by [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) and [Michał Fux](@/w/michal-fux.md). Afterwards, [Hans Schulte](@/w/hans-schulte.md) appeared on the screen and congratulated his countrymen for a job well done.
* [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) then came into the ring carrying his championship contract he won at [Godzina Zero 2025](@/e/kpw/2025-08-22-kpw-godzina-zero-2025.md) and said that had it not been for the Germans, he would be the next owner of both titles. Rookie Three (standing outside the ring but told by Lesak to come inside because so that he could hear him better), corrected him by pointing out that the contract is only valid for one championship title. He then added that Lesak had missed his chance by taking too long, which angered Eryk and prompted him to challenge Rookie Three to a fight. Victorious, Lesak left the arena carrying unconscious Rookie Three over his shoulder.
* Next, [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) came out and cut a promo (constantly heckled and interrupted by fans) saying that as long as Zefir and Leon Lato are Champions, his foot won't stand in the KPW ring. He punctuated his words by leaving his wrestling boots in the ring upon leaving it.

* Present in the audience was [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) with [Legacy's](@/o/low.md) Merch Stand Ania.
* There was a ladder stashed under the ring, but it wasn't used during the show.
