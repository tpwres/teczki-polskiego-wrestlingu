Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_) 2024 was the seventh annual KPW supershow, held since 2016.
Unlike most previous editions, GZ'24 was held in September.
It also marked the first time a main KPW event was not held in the [Nowy Harem club](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md), since the promotion returned there with [Arena 18](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md).
The change of venue to a larger gym hall of a school at Stefana Okrzei 6 street was dictated by the increased interest in recent events, with Arenas [21](@/e/kpw/2023-02-24-kpw-arena-21.md), [23](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md), [24](@/e/kpw/2024-02-16-kpw-arena-24-zagrozenie-lawinowe.md), [25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) and [GZ'23](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) selling out and additional tickets being made available.
The move, according to Chairman Malinowski, was temporary and the promotion still does business with Nowy Harem.

There were a significant number of foreign talent at this event, including some new guests:

* Hungarian wrestler and former [KPW champion](@/c/kpw-championship.md) [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), last seen two years prior, at [Powrót do Przyszłości](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md).
* From England, "Multiversal" Alexander Roth and "Big Wavy" Roy Johnson, competing as "The 87".
* One half of Die Ordnung, former [KPW Tag Team champions](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md): German wrestler Hans Schulte.
* The reigning KPW Champion, Italian wrestler Red Scorpion, in only his second defense of the title since winning it at [last year's event](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md).
* Spanish wrestler Carlos Zamora, in his second appearance, previously seen at [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md).
* Also from Germany, Flexos, previously seen at [Arena 22](@/e/kpw/2023-05-19-kpw-arena-22.md)
* Scottish wrestler Jack Jester, making his KPW debut. Jack is a veteran of ICW, and their Heavyweight champion in his second reign.
* "Anglo-Greek Warrior" Reece Alexios, competing primarily in UK and recently in Australia, making his KPW debut.

#### Build-up

* In [his video][malinowski-video], Chairman Malinowski teased the return of a match type that used to be a staple of Godzina Zero - perhaps a Magnificent Seven Match.
* In the same video Malinowski stated that Greg would face Fynn Freyhart at [Pyrkon 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-06-15-kpw-pyrkon-2024.md) and if he won, he'd get to challenge Red Scorpion for the KPW Championship at Godzina Zero 2024. Greg lost the match, leaving the championship match-up in the air.
* Chairman Malinowski announced that all three championships would be defended.
* Starting on June 22, 2024, KPW began a series of daily posts revealing the wrestlers that would appear on the show. One of them was the former champion [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), last seen at Arena 18.
* Chemik posted a [video][chemik-video] stating that he did a whole lot of bad things to get [his title](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) and that losing it would be like the end of the world to him. Perhaps tying into the name of the [previous event](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md), he said "I did so many bad things that when I stand at the Pearly Gates, Saint Peter himself will kick my ass so hard I'll fly down straight to the ninth circle of hell", adding that the belt constitutes his identity.
* About a week later [another video][rosetti-video], filmed by an unknown person, showed an angry Rosetti making a phone call to Greg, during which the two argued about the ownership of the [Old Town Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md): Rosetti calling it his belt, and Greg firmly stating that it belongs to the Gregorian Branch. After a brief exchange Greg changed the subject, ordering Rosetti to cooperate with [Eryk Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md) during the Magnificent Seven match, because all that matters is that the Championship contract goes to the Gregorian Branch. Greg then hung up, leaving the irritated Rosetti in mid-sentence.

#### Recap

* Before the Magnificent Seven match began, the wrestlers took turns on the microphone, starting with Rosetti, for whom the mic didn't work and his promo couldn't be heard.
  After Hans Schulte insulted Zefir, he grabbed the mic and for a moment it seemed like he was going to say something, but he drop-kicked Schulte instead.
* During the Magnificent Seven match, Rosetti, who was aiming for Zefir, accidentally hit Eryk Lesak in the head with a steel chair. Moments later, when both opponents were on the ground, Rosetti raised the chair to hit Zefir, but then turned on Lesak and attacked him, eliminating him from the fight.
* Towards the end of the Magnificent Seven match, Zefir and Hans Schulte were trading blows on top of a ladder, when Schulte grabbed Zefir by the head and pulled off his mask. Zefir covered his features with his hands, thus retaining his anonymity, but losing the fight in the process. After the bell rang, one of the ring crew members offered Zefir a towel to hide his visage and led him backstage.
* After Greg lost to Ron Corvus, he was attacked with a chair to the back by Rosetti, who was angry with Greg for the way he dismissed Rosetti's loss of the [KPW Old Town Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md) to Chemik.
  A few moments later, Chemik and Eryk Lesak rushed into the ring and chased Rosetti away, only to unexpectedly turn on Greg themselves, thus ending the Gregorian Branch.
  With Greg out of the ring, they cut a short promo about how when they joined the branch, Greg was someone estabilished, a true leader. But nowadays after his losing streak, he was no longer worth following.
* After Red Scorpion defended the title against Jack Jester, Hans Schulte ran into the ring to cash in his championship contract won in the Magnificent Seven match.
