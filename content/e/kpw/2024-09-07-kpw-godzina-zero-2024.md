Godzina Zero (_Zero Hour_) 2024 is an upcoming seventh annual KPW supershow, held since 2016. Unlike most previous editions, GZ'24 is going to be held in September. It also marks the first time a main KPW event won't be held in the [Nowy Harem club](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md), since the promotion returned there with [Arena 18](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md). The change of venue to a larger gym hall of a school at Stefana Okrzei 6 street was dictated by the increased interest in recent events, with Arenas [21](@/e/kpw/2023-02-24-kpw-arena-21.md), [23](@/e/kpw/2023-11-24-kpw-arena-23.md), [24](@/e/kpw/2024-02-16-kpw-arena-24-zagrozenie-lawinowe.md), [25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) and [GZ'23](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md) selling out and additional tickets being made available. The move, according to Chairman Malinowski, is a temporary one and the promotion still does business with Nowy Harem.

According to KPW's event page, there will be a significant number of foreign talent at this event, including some new guests:

* Hungarian wrestler and former KPW champion [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), last seen two years prior, at [Powrót do Przyszłości](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md).
* From England, "Multiversal" Alexander Roth and "Big Wavy" Roy Johnson, competing as "The 87".
* One half of Die Ordnung, former KPW Tag Team champions: German wrestler Hans Schulte.
* The reigning KPW Champion, Italian wrestler Red Scorpion, in only his second defense of the title since winning it at [last year's event](@/e/kpw/2023-08-18-kpw-godzina-zero-2023.md).
* Spanish wrestler Carlos Zamora, in his second appearance, previously seen at [Arena 18](@/e/kpw/2022-03-18-kpw-arena-18-powrot-do-przyszlosci.md).
* Also from Germany, Flexos, previously seen at [Arena 22](@/e/kpw/2023-05-19-kpw-arena-22.md)
* Scottish veteran Jack Jester, making his KPW debut. Jack is a veteran of ICW, and their Heavyweight champion in his second reign.
* "Anglo-Greek Warrior" Reece Alexios, competing primarily in UK and recently in Australia, making his KPW debut.

#### Build-up

* In [his video][malinowski-video], Chairman Malinowski teased the return of a match type that used to be a staple of Godzina Zero - perhaps a Magnificent Seven Match.
* In the same video Malinowski stated that Greg would face Fynn Freyhart at [Pyrkon 2024](@/e/kpw/2024-06-15-kpw-pyrkon-2024.md) and if he won, he'd get to challenge Red Scorpion for the KPW Championship at Godzina Zero 2024. Greg lost the match, leaving the championship match-up in the air.
* Chairman Malinowski announced that all three championships would be defended.
* Starting on June 22, 2024, KPW started daily posts revealing the wrestlers that would appear on the show. One of them was the former champion [Ron Corvus](@/w/ron-corvus.md), last seen at Arena 18.
