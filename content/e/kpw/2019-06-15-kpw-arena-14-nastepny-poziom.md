Następny Poziom (_The Next Level_) was held as part of the third (and final) SzlamFest. In terms of KPW history, it was a regular Arena show, continuing the storylines from Arena 13. The venue was Klub B90, a music and event space, located in the popular post-shipyard part of Gdańsk.

This event had a major foreign guest - British wrestler Mark Haskins, who by then has appeared for NJPW and Ring of Honor, as well as countless British organizations. Other foreign wrestlers were the returning [Dom Taylor](@/w/dom-taylor.md), the veteran Anton Green, and 19-year old female wrestler Chakara.

### Build-up

* Oliwa previously won the #1 Contender's match aagainst [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md).
* KPW [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kpwrestling/posts/pfbid02fGtUG8wuaMW25FV76VqSQHECjCVqt1E4McUNJmBhFu9x3mKLNE4HWao94yK7UEXal) that [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) was fired for breaking terms of his contract that he allegedly signed with [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) back at Arena X. This likely referred to him not surrendering the championship belt won at Arena 13 to Kawaler. In effect, the KPW Championship was vacant.
* Kawaler was also suspended since Arena 11, for attacking the referee who disqualified the team of Robert and Kawaler from their second round match, for being under the influence.

### Recap

* Ring announcer Arkadiusz Pawłowski had left KPW following Arena 13. He was replaced by a female announcer, Kinga.
* [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) issued an open challenge, which was accepted by Anton Green.
* Chairman Krystian Malinowski appeared, reinstated Robert and added him to the main event.
* Like on previous editions of SzlamFest, there was one hardcore match. This time it was Dawid and [Greg](@/w/greg.md) who used chains, kendo sticks, chairs, ladders and lighting tubes on each other.
* [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md) was also reinstated to the roster after defeating Haskins, and completing two other tasks that the Chairman gave him previously in recorded vignettes.
