Ring announcer: Arkadiusz Pawłowski

#### Recap

* Fans annoy Gracjan by calling him Gracjan Porno. Krzysztof Zasada protects Kowalski, and annoyed at his boss, dropkicks him with his signature catphrase "W imię zasad!"
* Ostrowski enters with not only Mira, but an unnamed second girl. She would later be revealed as Alisa.
* After the event, Pawłowski announced a surprise, and invited the faces to the ring. Pannache takes over the mic, and explains that Dawid Oliwa celebrated his (28th) birthday just days before. A birthday cake is revealed, decorated with the KPW logo. Fans sing "Sto Lat" (Polish _Happy Birthday_ song). Kawaler's music hits, Greg walks in, and declares his disregard for the birthday, only to get the cake in his face to great crowd reactions.
