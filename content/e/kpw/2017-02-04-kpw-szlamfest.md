SzlamFest billed itself as a celebration of low culture: comics, retro games, B-class movies, meetings with authors, YouTubers and bloggers. And a wrestling show. Three editions were held between 2017 and 2019. The fourth edition in 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the festival never returned. KPW would hold events on all editions, but only the first one would be named after the event - the others were billed as regular Arena shows.

The event, and festival, were held in B90, a music and event venue located in a former industrial building belonging to [Gdańsk Shipyard](@/v/stocznia-gdanska.md).

#### Summary

* In the ladies' pillow fight match, a mattress with some pillows and covers was installed in the ring. At some point [Bianca](@/w/bianca.md) escapes from the ring, chased by [Mira](@/w/mira.md), to later hide under the covers while Mira wasn't looking. Mira decides to do a top-rope splash on the bed, discovering Bianca and attempting a pin with her still wrapped in the covers.
* Weapons used by Corvus and [Greg](@/w/greg.md) include a kendo stick, chairs, an empty beer crate and an old PC case.
