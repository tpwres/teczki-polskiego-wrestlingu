SzlamFest billed itself as a celebration of low culture: comics, retro games, B-class movies, meetings with authors, YouTubers and bloggers. And a wrestling show. Three editions were held between 2017 and 2019. The fourth edition in 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the festival never returned. KPW would hold events on all editions, but only the first one would be named after the event - the others were billed as regular Arena shows.

The event, and festival, were held in B90, a music and event venue located in a former industrial building belonging to Gdańsk Shipyard.

#### Summary

* In the ladies' pillow fight match, a mattress with some pillows and covers was installed in the ring. At some point Bianca escapes from the ring, chased by Mira, to later hide under the covers while Mira wasn't looking. Mira decides to do a top-rope splash on the bed, discovering Bianca and attempting a pin with her still wrapped in the covers.
* Weapons used by Corvus and Greg include a kendo stick, chairs, an empty beer crate and an old PC case.
