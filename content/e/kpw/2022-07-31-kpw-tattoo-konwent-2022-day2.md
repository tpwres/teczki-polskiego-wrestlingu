Tattoo Konwent is an event focused on the art of tattoo. Since 2014, it's been held several times a year in major cities in Poland, e.g. Gdańsk, Łódź, Poznań, Wrocław, but notably not in Warsaw which has its own, similarly named event. It's often accompanied by concerts, art exhibitions and workshops.

In 2022, KPW was featured as part of the Gdańsk edition, held in the city's exhibition center, Amber Expo. On both days, KPW performed in several 20-minute timeslots, one match each time. This page covers Sunday, day 2.

Swedish wrestler Steinbolt was the foreign guest this time, along with now regular Darius. The event saw one debut on day 1: Leon Lato, a wrestler from Toruń.
