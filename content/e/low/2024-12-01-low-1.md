The first [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) event took place on December 1st, 2024 in Katowice, in the Królestwo music club.

The overall attendance at the show was approximately a little over 300 viewers, as LoW announced full soldout before the show.

### Build-up

Legacy planned for their first show to be a supercard, collaborating with most of the active wrestling organizations in Poland. The event was to feature at least one wrestler from each.
Notably, the sole exception was [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), with which many of the wrestlers present have split from after [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), some of them [quite bitterly](@/a/ptw-exits.md).
Among the wrestlers confirmed to be on the card were [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md), [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) and [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md).

On 12.11.2024, Legacy announced, that they managed to sign an official TV deal with Extreme Sports Channel - becoming the first polish pro wrestling federation to sign such a deal before producing their first show. They also announced that TV premiere of their show will take place one week after the event - on 08.12.2024.

Between 27th and 29th of November Legacy of Wrestling published a serie of posts announing number of sponsors of the federation.

On 29.11 Legacy announced, that they managed to sold out the event.

On 2.11.2024, [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) [issued an open challenge][yt-chemik-challenge] for his [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md), stating that boundaries exist in Polish wrestling for a reason and he intends to prove it by defeating anyone who thinks himself worthy of the title.

In a 20.11.2024 [Facebook post][no-longman-but-axel] Legacy announced that Wiktor Longman won't be able to make an appearance and the main event will feature [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) instead.

{% timeline() %}

#### Opening

* Timestamp: `0:00:01`
* [Arek Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) enters the ring. He greets the fans and announces that LoW is the first federation in Poland to secure TV-Deal before first show. He hypes up the match card and thanks to the sponsors of the show. All of that is filled with few jabs mocking his ex-employer - [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).
* Paterek announces the official show host, clearly implying that it would be "Mr Chairman", but the lights suddenly go off.
* [Sinister's](@/w/sinister.md) theme plays, much to the crowd pop. He makes his way to the ring meeting face-2-face with Paterek.
* Sinister talks with Arek about mysterious "secrets" that commentator is supposed to have. The Supreme Evil then offers him a handshake, which Paterek hesitantly accepts, Sinister hugs him and gives him kiss on the cheek, then excuses him out of the ring.
* Sinister cuts short promo describing Legacy as "different circus but with the same monkeys". He also declares, that he will deal with people, who supposedly turned on him, when he was helping them - possibly refering to [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md).
* After he announces the beggining of the show [Sewi The Referee](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) enters the ring paying tribute to AEW legend - The Rizzler. Knocked of the rythm Sinister rigs him for distrupting his announcement.

* Chemik manages to get upper hand over Sambor while Dziedzic is beaten down, but after few innefective attempts of securing pinfall victory he is taken down by running knee strike from Sambor.
* Current champion leaves the ring which allow the contenders to pull of some back-and-forth action.

* [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) is the latter one to enter the ring.
* Match seems to be babyface vs babyface exhibition with both wrestlers showing themselves respect.
* Shadow is portrayed as the veteran, but Marcelito often outshines him by pulling of couple of decent moves in high-flying style - a Shadow's speciality.

* Timestamp: `00:40:40`
* [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) makes his way to the ring rocking his solo theme song - Sicario by Słoń.
* [Biesiad's](@/w/biesiad.md) theme song is playing, while the loud "JESTEM CIEŚLĄ!" (_I am a carpenter_) is heard. The hyped up crowd is chanting "Cieśla!" - instead of classic "Biesaid!" - when he arrives on stage to throw chair into the ring and make a big leap from stage to apron. Seweryn quickly orders to ring the bell as the brawl starts.
* Biesiad quickly takes The Hooligan down. Takes out can of beer from his jacket just to drink a bit of it and pour the rest on his opponent. The brawl quickly moves to the outside where Biesiad loses the initiative when Olgierd throws him into the chairs occupied by the crowd.
* Olgierd tries to pull unsuccessfull pinfall attempt inside the ring, then he goes outside to get table. While he is trying to put it inside the ring he is countered by law of the lever from Biesiad, who strikes Olgierd in the face with said table. Biesiad hit his signature Table Suplex with half of the object and regains control over the match.
* After smashing Olgierd chest with kendo stick The Carpenter is again overpowered by his opponent, who attacks him with cardboard box of LoW sponsor - Express Pizza. Member of Legia Łysych dominates for some time using kendo stick and his own head before making fatal decision to mock Biesiad with his own attempt to hit Table Suplex. This enrages Biesiad who is not affected by his own move, and after short power struggle he regains control after hitting 619.
* Olgierd rolls out of the ring while Strong is setting up four tables in the corners but gets thrown through one of it by Olgierd who managed to save some strenght at the ringside.

#### Disco Pablo's Musical Chairs

* Timestamp: `01:10:35`
* [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) is making way to the ring dancing to his new theme song. He greets the public and hypes up the crowd. He says that despite the fact that he is not in any of the matches, he still wants to compete in some form of a contest, so he announces that he organised Musical Chairs competition.
* Pablo invites LoW personnel responsible for making the show happen - Ania and [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md) enter the ring.
* Pablo announces the fourth competitor - Mr Chairman himself. He makes his way to the ring and cuts short promo about the path that led to creating Legacy of Wrestling. After Chairman promo the contest starts.

He then fires up on [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md) for stealing his creatine during one of the trips to Hungary, which was covered in one of his [vlogs][lysy-vlog-creatine-controversy].
* Filip Fux interrupts his promo entering the ring with his [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) belt and creatine in his hand.
* Fux offers the creatine to Marco which make him visibly happy, but when he realises that the container is empty he tries to attack his opponent.

* Marco regains control and begins to beat up Filip with only a few fightbacks from Fux brother. Finally he is able to make a comeback after dodging Marco's corner attack and hitting him with Diving Crossbody, which was not enough to end the match. Both fighters go back-and-forth trying to hit each other with their finishing moves, but it is Filip Fux who manages to dodge Ripcord Lariat to hit Marco with Cutter.
* Olgierd makes his way from the backstage and jumps on the apron to distract both Referee and Filip. This allows Marco to hit low blow on Filip without catching Sewi's attention. After that he debuts his new finisher - Fisherman Driver to end up a match.
* Winner: Marco Hammers by pinfall
* Legia Łysych celebrates over unconcious Fux's body while holding both PTW Intergender and KPW Tag Team Championship belts up in the air. Hooligans presents Tag Team title to crowd and camera, strongly suggesting, that they demand a match for those championships in [KPW](@/o/kpw.md).

* Polish Fox is shining at the beggining of the match, controlling the match and attempting to score multiple flash pin vicotries. Gustav is visibly stunned by form of Axel Fox and tries to avoid confrontation in the corner. He is however pulled off and forced to fight by Referee. After quick regroup Gustav tries to dominate Axel in headlock, but he frees himself and hits the champion with Flying Shoulderblock. Gustav rolls out of the ring while being mocked by Axel, which leads Gustav to spit in Axel's eye. He wants to chase after Gryffin around the ringside, but gets stopped by Linde, who recieves stern warning from referee about not trying to interfere in the match.
* Distraction allows Gustav to regain control over the match for some time, but soon after the championship contender gains the initiative to fight back. Short ringside brawl emerges and Gustav is again in position of power. He dominates Axel Fox for quite some time both in-ring and again at the ringside, where he leaves wounded Fox to be counted-out. Fox manages to get in when referee is counting 9 out of 10, but Gustav still controls the match until Fox manages to hit Stunner to start his comeback.
* After Axel managed to hit Gustav with couple of strong moves he tries to climb top rope to perform his Firefox Elbow Drop, but Gustav cuts him off and tries to perform Air Raid Crash on Axel, he however counters it to huge Powerbomb on Gustav, which nearly ends the fight before Gryffin manages to kick out at very last of second.
* Fox is trying to hit another running move, but Gustav protects himself with faking injury which distracts Sewi and stops Axel. It gives the opportunity for Jakub Linde to jump on the apron and choke Axel, but Referee sees that and throws away Gustav's personal trainer. While he is arguing with referee he also recieves Bicycle Kick from Fox. This however allows Gustav to hit Powerbomb and Lariat on Axel, which was another nearfall.
* Both exausted - Axel and Gustav - exchange strikes until the challenger gets the upper hand to finally hit Gustav with powerfull knee right to the head and go for Diving Elbow Drop to finish the match.
* Axel fox pins Gustav and the Referee Seweryn is counting to three. Crowd goes wild as Axel Fox is crowned as PpW Champion.
* While Axel is still celebrating Sinister and Mr Chairman enters the ring to talk with Referee Seweryn, who goes from happiness to despair in a single second after hearing the news from Host and Chairman of LoW.
* Finally after some time of chaos Arek Paterek gets to the microphone and announces that due to fact, that Gustav Gryffin left hand was under the rope - signalising rope break - the Referee Seweryn made the three count which was in fact invalid due to said rope break. The match is announced to being restarted immediately - much to the Axel's despair.
* PpW Championship is taken from heartbroken Fox's hands as the bell rings again. Axel isn't even capable of realising what happened, as Gustav quickly and forcefully goes after him with Rear Naked Choke and win the match.
* Winner: Gustav Gryffin by technical submission
* Gustav celebrates his victory with Jakub Linde, much to the crowd heat towards him. He is declaring that nobody will be ever able to dethrone him. Crowd is chanting "Bullshit!"

#### Ending
