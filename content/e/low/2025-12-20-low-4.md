Four the Glory is an upcoming show by [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), set to return to [Królestwo music club](@/v/krolestwo-katowice.md) in Katowice.

Like at the [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), two tiers of tickets were made available. In addition to regular tickets there was also a special package with a limited T-shirt bearing a "Legacy of Wrestling vol. √16" logo, referencing a joke made by one of the fans.

On 2.10.2025 a [live Q&A][live-qa-4] took place, hosted by [Wiktor D.](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) in addition to the usual host [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md).
