Four the Glory is an upcoming show by [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), set to return to [Królestwo music club](@/v/krolestwo-katowice.md) in Katowice.

Like at the [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), two tiers of tickets were made available. In addition to regular tickets there was also a special package with a limited T-shirt bearing a "Legacy of Wrestling vol. √16" logo, referencing a joke made by one of the fans.

On 2.10.2025 a [live Q&A][live-qa-4] took place, hosted by [Wiktor D.](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) in addition to the usual host [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md).

## Build-up

* On 7.11.2025 Legacy revealed the first wrestler to appear at the show: [Gulyás Öcsi](@/w/gulyas-ocsi.md). This his debut for the promotion, but he has previously competed for [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) at [Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) and several times for [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), most recently in June 2025 at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md).
* On 10.11.2025 Legacy announced that [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md), will be joining the commentary team as a guest. Rosetti recently took on commentary duties in KPW after a 10 year in-ring career.
* On 13.11.2025 Legacy booked [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) vs [Erik Šlotíř](@/w/erik-slotir.md) in a 12 Weapons of Christmas No-DQ Match, in which twelve "presents" will be placed in and around the ring.
* Three days later, on 16.11.2025 the main event was revealed: a Six-Way Elimination Match between [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md). The same post revealed the name of LOW's first title: the [Legacy of Wrestling European Championship](@/c/low-european-championship.md), and the victor will become the inaugural champion.
* On 27.11.2025 [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) was confirmed for the event, with no info as to his opponent.
* Following that, on 4.12.2025 Legacy announced Curtis Black vs [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md).
