Four the Glory was a show by [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), once again held in [Królestwo music club](@/v/krolestwo-katowice.md) in Katowice.

Like at the [second show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), two tiers of tickets were made available. In addition to regular tickets there was also a special package with a limited T-shirt bearing a "Legacy of Wrestling vol. √16" logo, referencing a joke made by one of the fans.

On 2.10.2025 a [live Q&A][live-qa-4] took place, hosted by [Wiktor D.](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) in addition to the usual host [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md).

## Build-up

* On 7.11.2025 Legacy revealed the first wrestler to appear at the show: [Gulyás Öcsi](@/w/gulyas-ocsi.md). This his debut for the promotion, but he has previously competed for [KPW](@/o/kpw.md) at [Arena 25](@/e/kpw/2024-05-17-kpw-arena-25.md) and several times for [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), most recently in June 2025 at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md).
* On 10.11.2025 Legacy announced that [Rosetti](@/w/rosetti.md) will be joining the commentary team as a guest. Rosetti recently took on commentary duties in KPW after a 10 year in-ring career.
* On 13.11.2025 Legacy booked [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) vs [Erik Šlotíř](@/w/erik-slotir.md) in a 12 Weapons of Christmas No-DQ Match, in which twelve "presents" will be placed in and around the ring.
* Three days later, on 16.11.2025, the main event was revealed: a Six-Way Elimination Match between [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Syriusz Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md), [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md). The same post revealed the name of LOW's first title: the [Legacy of Wrestling European Championship](@/c/low-european-championship.md). The victor of the match will become the inaugural champion.
* On 27.11.2025 [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) was confirmed for the event, with no information regarding his opponent.
* Following that, on 4.12.2025 Legacy announced Curtis Black vs [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md). Black, alongside Barbarossa, previously challenged the [Fux Brothers](@/tt/bracia-fux.md) for their [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md) at [KPW Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md).
* 10.12.2025 saw the announcement of [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) (the current [PpW Champion](@/c/ppw-championship.md)) vs [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) in a non-title match.
* The final match announced for the show, on 14.12.2025, was a Triple Threat Match betweem [Filip Fux](@/w/filip-fux.md), [Gulyás Öcsi](@/w/gulyas-ocsi.md) and [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md).
* The day before the show Legacy published a [post][krecika-nie-bedzie] on Facebook informing that Erik Šlotíř won't appear due to an injury. Disco Pablo's match is still in effect, but his opponent won't be known until the last moment.

### Recap

* The show was hosted by [Adrian Zgórski](@/w/adrian-zgorski.md) from [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). Unlike in his home promotion, where he opens with [Michael Buffer's][michal-bufor] trademark(-ed) phrase "Let's get ready to rumble!", here he went with the Polish "Lecimy po zwycięstwo!" (_Let's go for the victory!_), which has a similar rhythm and the same number of syllables.
* During the opener, Curtis Black ended up on his knees by the ropes. The crowd started to chant "6-1-9!", urging Marco Hammers to perform the move on his opponent. Marco obliged but comically botched the spot, earning him a big round of applause and a chant of "Dziękujemy!" (_Thank you!_). Annoyed, Marco flipped the audience off.
* For the 12 Weapons of Christmas Match, [Sędzia Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md) came in carrying a few gift bags and two long, narrow items wrapped in colourful paper. Other similarly gift-wrapped items had been placed under the ring prior to the start of the show.
* Just like at [MZW Zjedz Mu Łeb](@/e/mzw/2025-09-27-mzw-zjedz-mu-leb.md), Adi and [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) briefly got down to Pablo's theme song.
* Erik Šlotíř's replacement turned out to be [Tony Sheen](@/w/riverman.md).
* Pablo and Tony started the match by each taking one of the long items held by [Sędzia Seweryn](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md). After Pablo made his pick, Sheen said he wanted "the longer one" and snatched the present from his opponent's hands, leacing Pablo with his unwanted gift. After unwrapping it turned out Tony got a broom handle, and Disco Pablo got a kendo stick.
* Another present were a pair of headphones. When placed by Pablo on Tony's head, they caused Sheen to briefly dance to some electronic music, conveniently played over the loudspeakers for the benefit of the audience. Disco Pablo joined him, and even Seweryn moved his body a little.
* Other presents included a stepladder, a toy dart gun (used by Pablo to assault Tony's crotch), a roll of black duct tape, a leather belt, a steel chair, some Christmas ornaments (one of which Disco Pablo attempted to shove up Riverman's derrière) and a length of steel chain (which Tony choked Pablo with, earning him some ["Olgierd!"](@/e/ppw/2025-12-06-ppw-duch-swiat-smak-krwi.md) chants).
* After winning the match, Tony Sheen opened the final present for himself: a T-shirt of [Arek Paterek's](@/w/arek-paterek.md) stable, Biuro Prasowe, which he officially joined.
* Tony then grabbed the steel chair and was about to attack the defeated Pablo, when suddenly the lights went out. When they came back, [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) was on a turnbuckle, waiting to attack the Riverman as soon as he turned around.
* After chasing Sheen away, Marcelito issued an open challenge. It was answered by ["Lady Killer" Boro](@/w/boro.md).

* 
* [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md) was present at the backstage, but unlike at the previous three shows, this time he didn't have a match.
