The third [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) show is set to take place in the [Tauron Arena](@/v/tauron-arena.md) in Kraków, on Friday, 11th of July 2025. This will be the first day of Ryucon 2025, a manga-themed convention which for the previous three years hosted shows by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

## Build-up

* At [Legacy vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) confronted [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and challanged him to a fight. Taras initially refused, but relented when Pablo gave him the choice of stipulation.
* On 4.06.2025 Legacy published [a video][uliczne-disco] in which Taras announced his decision. The match between him and Pablo is going to be a Street Fight, with a "[certain green individual](@/w/boro.md)" who just came back from France acting as a Special Guest Referee.
* The first officially announced fight, on 30.06.2025, was [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) vs Hungarian wrestler Zétény, in a Road to the Title Match.
* On 2.07.2025 Legacy announced [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) vs [Dieter Schwartz](@/w/dieter-schwartz.md), who previously made a few appearances for [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) shows.
* The following day Legacy released a [video][marco-wszystkich-rozwali] of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) training with [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) and being given a spot on the card in the title tournament, against a mystery opponent.
* On 6.07.2025, Legacy's social media recalled the creation of [Arek Paterek's](@/w/arek-paterek.md) "Press Office", and his first international client - Erik Šlotiř. Erik won his five-man match, and the Press Office demanded a more challenging opponent for him at the third show. The Czech wrestler was announced for the show, "in action" but with no further details.
