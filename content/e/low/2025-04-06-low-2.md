The second [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) show, set to take place in the Kr√≥lestwo music club in Katowice.

Two tiers of tickets were made available for this show - regular tickets, and limited VIP tickets (available until mid-March) that also include the show's T-shirt and a poster signed by the wrestlers. The official Patronite wasn't promoted this time.

A [live Q&A][live-qa-3] took place the day after the announcement of the show, to answer fans' questions.
