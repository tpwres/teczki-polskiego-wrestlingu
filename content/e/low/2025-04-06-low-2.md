The second [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) show, set to take place in the Królestwo music club in Katowice.

Two tiers of tickets were made available for this show - regular tickets, and limited VIP tickets (available until mid-March) that also include the show's T-shirt and a poster signed by the wrestlers. The official Patronite wasn't promoted this time.

A [live Q&A][live-qa-3] took place the day after the announcement of the show, to answer fans' questions.

### Build-up

In it, Dziedzic insisted on getting his revenge on [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) for interfering at the [last show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). Mr. Chairman agreed, and promised something extra.
* On the next day, Legacy announced a debut of [Greg](@/w/greg.md) from [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).
