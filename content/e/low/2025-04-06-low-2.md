The second [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) show, set to take place in the Królestwo music club in Katowice.

Two tiers of tickets were made available for this show - regular tickets, and limited VIP tickets (available until mid-March) that also include the show's T-shirt and a poster signed by the wrestlers. The official Patronite wasn't promoted this time.

A [live Q&A][live-qa-3] took place the day after the announcement of the show, to answer fans' questions.

### Build-up

* On 6.03.2025 a [recording][rozmowa] of a call between [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and Mr. Chairman was released. In it, Dziedzic insisted on getting his revenge on [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) for interfering at the [last show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md). Mr. Chairman agreed, and promised something extra.
* On the next day, Legacy announced the debut of [Greg](@/w/greg.md) from [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md).
* On 9.03.2025 Kubes, an American independent wrestler of Polish descent, was officially confirmed.
* On 12.03.2025 Legacy announced the debut of [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), currently affiliated with [PpW](@/o/ppw.md).
* At the [first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) expressed interest in Filip's title. On 14.03.2025 Legacy announced that the second show's main event would be a Tag-Team Match bewteen the Fux Brothers and Legia Łysych for the [KPW Tag Team Championship](@/c/kpw-tag-team-championship.md).
* All graphics released up to this point had a typo: the dates said 2024, not 2025.
* On 17.03, it was [confirmed][greg-v-golden] that Vic Golden and Greg would face each other. This match is the Legacy debut for both of them.
* Legacy [announced][title-road-1] [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) vs [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) on 21.03, stating that this will be a Road to the Title Match, with the winner qualifying for the future contendership for the Legacy Championship, intended to be introduced at some, as yet unknown, point in the future.
* The next day saw the [announcement][title-road-2] of [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) vs Kubes as another Road to the Title Match.
* On 23.03 Legacy posted an announcement stating that [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) would appear on the show and address the events of the [first one](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md), where he and [ShowOff](@/w/piotr-malecki.md) were attacked by [Taras](@/w/taras.md).
* Less than 24 hours later another post announced that [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) would make an appearance as a special guest, to "observe the show up close".
* On 26.03.2025 Legacy announced [David Oliwa](@/w/david-oliwa.md) would have a match against an unspecified opponent.
* On 28.03.2025, Legacy released a [kayfabe phone call][phone-call] recording of [Arek Paterek](@/w/arek-paterek.md) commenting on "the events that transpired at the first show". He criticised LOW's 'unsafe working environment' and Mr Chairman's inability to "get things done". Paterek demanded a "personal immunity clause" to be written into his contract and promised to bring along someone who would "help Mr Chairman get things sorted out". The whole tirade seemingly pertains to Taras attacking Disco Pablo and ShowOff, but it turns out that Paterek is more concerned with the finish of the show and the messy main event. The recording ends with him confirming that all he said also applies to ShowOff being attacked.
* On 30.03.2025 Legacy announced that [Taras](@/w/taras.md) intends to appear at the show and, like Disco Pablo, also address the events of the first event.
