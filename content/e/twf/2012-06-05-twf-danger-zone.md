TWF: Danger Zone was a show produced by [Toruń Wrestling Federation](@/o/twf.md). It was published on June 5th, 2012. 

The original post published at wrestling forums declares the show's date to be May 27th, but due to the fact that [TWF: Day of DOOM!](@/e/twf/2012-06-03-twf-day-of-doom.md) was released on June 6th and this show continues storylines from it, it is believed that chronology error is caused by Day of DOOM! tape delay.
