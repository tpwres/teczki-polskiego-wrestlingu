TWF: Danger Zone was a show produced by [Toruń Wrestling Federation](@/o/twf.md). It was published on March 31st, 2012. 

The original post published at wrestling forums declares the show's date to be March 24th, but due to the fact that [TWF: Fight For The Freedom!](@/e/twf/2012-03-28-twf-fight-for-freedom.md) was released on March 28th and this show continues storylines from it, it is believed that this error in chronology is caused by tape delay.
