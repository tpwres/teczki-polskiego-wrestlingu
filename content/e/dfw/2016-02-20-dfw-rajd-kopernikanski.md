[DFW's](@/o/dfw.md) fourth show was held on Saturday, February 20 2016. According to the video description and Facebook post, the event accompanied the 33rd Copernican Rally, which is a gathering of scouting organizations of all ages, where they can also compete in sports, and cross-country trekking.

Chris Hunter did double duty, as Malmo Buruto who was supposed to face Corin Mear in the opening match, suffered a concussion two days before the event.
