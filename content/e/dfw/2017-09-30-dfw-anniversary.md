Anniversary was an event that celebrated DFW's second anniversary, held on Saturday, September 30, 2017. The name was a bit of a stretch as it was the second anniversary, but only when counting from [DFW @ Kaszczorek](@/e/dfw/2015-09-20-dfw-showcase.md) which was DFW's second show rather than first. Counting from the first show, the second anniversary was instead much closer to [Crosswords City](@/e/dfw/2017-06-17-dfw-crosswords-city.md).

The event was held in the sports hall belonging to {{ map_pin(v="Copernicus University sports hall") }}Nicolaus Copernicus University, same one that hosted [Tournament of Dreams](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md) and [Recent Dreams](@/e/dfw/2017-04-23-dfw-recent-dreams.md).

Featuring a battle royale match to select the next contender for Revage's DFW championship, and a street fight defense, this was probably DFW's biggest ever event. [PpW's](@/o/ppw.md) Cade Bruce contended in both a singles match and the battle royale.

### Recap

* The #1 Contender match was ultimately meaningless, as Prince Victor never challenged Revage for the title. For both of them it was the last appearance in DFW, as by that time they and Direk had already trained in [PAW](@/o/paw.md), and later that year joined [MZW](@/o/mzw.md).
* PJ Blake assumed the ring announcer duty for this event.
