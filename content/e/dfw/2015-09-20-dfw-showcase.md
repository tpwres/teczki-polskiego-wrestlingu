This event was the second ever [DFW](@/o/dfw.md) showcase before a live audience, held on Sunday, September 20, 2015. The ring was set outdoors, at the riding grounds of Toruński Klub Jazdy Konnej (_Toruń Equestrian Club_) in Kaszczorek, which is a south-eastern district of Toruń. Wrestiling was one of the attractions of a community festival, which also featured a vocal talent show, live music and bouncy castles for kids.

In the main event, Revage faced Chris Hunter in a rematch from the [previous show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md).

#### Recap

* The main event featured an accidental ref bump by Hunter. With the referee out of action, chairs were introduced to the ring, and after dropping Revage through them, Hunter pinned and counted to three himself.
  The match continued, and Revage landed a diving stomp just as the referee was back on his feet, winning by three-count.
* After the main event, Malmo and Pain Killer congratulated the winner, and entered the ring to attack Hunter. Encouraged by the audience, Revage ran back into the ring.
  This is the only shot in the whole video that we see the audience. Initially allowing Hunter to take a chairshot to the head, he superkicked Malmo and then Pain Killer, who was held over the shoulder of Hunter. The two opponents shook hands to close the show.
