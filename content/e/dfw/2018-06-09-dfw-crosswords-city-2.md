The final event from [DFW](@/o/dfw.md) was held almost three years after their first one, on Saturday, June 9th, 2018. The venue and occasion was once more a community festival in Krzyżówki, where the previous [Crosswords City](@/e/dfw/2017-06-17-dfw-crosswords-city.md) took place.

Only two matches were held, with the main event seeing Norris defend his championship against former tag team partner Rob Scaffold. It's also the only match that has been released online. Some members of the roster were present at ringside.

#### Recap

* In the final moments, we see Norris hang Rob in a tree of woe position, head down in a beer crate. Norris then lands a coast-to-coast jump into the crate. Scaffold fails to get up on his feet, and Norris is declared the last man standing, retaining the belt. His opponent is carried out on a stretcher in a dramatic ending, although the announcer fails to make it credible.
