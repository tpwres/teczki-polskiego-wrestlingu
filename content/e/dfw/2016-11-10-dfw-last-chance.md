This event took place on Thursday, November 10th, 2016, in yet another school in Toruń. This time it was {{ map_pin(v="ZSE Toruń") }}ZSE, a secondary school teaching mainly accounting and trade. The event's name likely refers to Direk's last chance at the DFW championship, which he won at the previous event by pinning champion Chris Hunter in a tag team match.
