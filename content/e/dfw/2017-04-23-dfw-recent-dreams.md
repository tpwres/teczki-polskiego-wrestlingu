[DFW's](@/o/dfw.md) Recent Dreams was held on Sunday, April 23 2017, once again in the sports hall of Toru≈Ñ's university campus. The previous event to be held there was the second half of [Tournament of Dreams](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md).

With 5 matches on the card, this was a big event by DFW's standards. In the main event Revage, who won the gauntlet match at the [previous show](@/e/dfw/2017-02-14-dfw-love-hurts-wrestling-even-more.md), challenged Hunter for the DFW championship.

#### Recap

* Corin Mear's bodypaint was inspired by the main character Aang from "Avatar the Last Airbender" animated series.
* After his match, Rob Scaffold assumed cameraman duties, and can be sometimes seen on footage from the other cameras, filming from the left side of the ring (from the audience's POV).
* Direk and Charlie start by exchanging various holds, to later transition into their usual stytyle. Later, weapons such as a kend sticks, chairs and a ladder are introduced. The match ended with Direk powerbombing Charlie through a table in the ring.
* Norris was supposed to face Malmo one on one. However, Hekate came out with a microphone and turned the fight into a tag team match, if Norris was able to find a partner. Corin Mear volunteered himself, and the match started.
* When Hekate was tagged in, she requested to tag in Corin Mear. Who then proceeded to announce that if he's fighting barechested, then she should remove her T-shirt as well. She obliged, revealing her usual gear underneath.
* In his recorded promo, PJ Blake issued a challenge to What Is Wrestling, who are wrestling content creators Seth Donner and Amisz. He called them keyboard warriors, who know nothing about the sport besides what they see on TV. Initially Donner responded, telling PJ that he's going to face his toughest opponent yet, but at the last moment he named the diminutive Amisz as his opponent. The match was a David vs Goliath comedy spotfest, with Amisz trying various ways to overcome the much heavier and taller PJ.
* A ref bump allowed Hunter, who was getting frustrated, to deck Revage with the championship belt. He then pinned his opponent while on his back, while the ref recovered. Revage managed to reach the bottom rope with his right leg, but the ref counted anyway. A decision was made to restart the match, after which an angry Hunter landed a lariat on the referee. Revage managed to land his Coup de Grace, then pinned Hunter to win by a very slow three-count.
