Crosswords City by [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) was a sideshow accompanying a community festival, the Firemen's Picnic. It took place on Saturday, June 17, 2017 in Krzyżówki, a village about 20&nbsp;km north of Włocławek, in the Kuyavia-Pomerania region of Poland. The event was held outdoors, on the village's sports and events grounds neighboring the local Fire brigade's location.

The event's name refers to the village: Krzyżówki can be translated as both _crossroads_ and _crosswords_. Fans saw the DFW debut of Prince Victor, who however only appeared for DFW again on the next event.
