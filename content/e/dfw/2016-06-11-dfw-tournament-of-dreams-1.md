The Tournament of Dreams was a two-part event to crown the first ever [DFW](@/o/dfw.md) champion. The first round of matches was held on Saturday, June 11th 2016 (this event), and the [finals](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md) two months later in August.

This event was held at the same location as DFW's [debut show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md) one year before, as part of another edition of the same community festival.

Norris made his DFW debut at this event. Since then, he appeared at every show that DFW held.
