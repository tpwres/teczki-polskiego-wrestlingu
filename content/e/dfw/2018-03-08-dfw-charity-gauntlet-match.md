This was a single match, accompanying a charity event which collected donations towards leukemia treatment for a girl from Lipno, where the event took place. Wrestlers competed for the vacant DFW Championship belt.

Previous champion [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md) left the organization to join [MZW](@/o/mzw.md), debuting at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) in December 2017, vacating the belt.
