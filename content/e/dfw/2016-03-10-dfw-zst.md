The fifth show by [DFW](@/o/dfw.md) was held, uncommonly, on Thursday, March 10th 2016. The show was held at ZST Toruń, which is a trade school, mainly focused on teaching jobs in the building industry. It also organizes classes preparing for military duty, where students wear military uniforms without insignia, and are expected to respect military-like discipline. It is for these classes that this show was held, in the school's auditorium.

#### Recap

* Charlie was the special ref for the first match, while Pain Killer was the ref for Charlie's match.
* The ring broke (top turnbuckle detached) after Revage ran into a corner with Pain Killer on his back trying to choke him. This is visible at about 3:58 in the recap video.
* At one point, Chris Hunter confronts an uniformed member of the audience. Seconds later, we see Chris receive a headscissor takedown from that audience member, about 13:06 in the recap video.
