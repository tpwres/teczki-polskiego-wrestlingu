This was [DFW's](@/o/dfw.md) second event held in ZST. The first one was held back [in March](@/e/dfw/2016-03-10-dfw-zst.md). This time, it's not an auditorium, but a gymnastics hall that sees the action.

Unlike the previous Tournament of Dreams, massive by DFW's standards, this event saw just three matches. In the main event Direk challenged Hunter for the DFW Championship.
