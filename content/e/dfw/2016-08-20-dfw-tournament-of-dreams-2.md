The Tournament of Dreams was a two-part event to crown the first ever [DFW](@/o/dfw.md) champion. The first round of matches was held in [June](@/e/dfw/2016-06-11-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-1.md), and the finals (this event) on Saturday August 20, 2016.

For this event, the venue was a sports hall belonging to local Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, located on the university campus in the western part of the city.

This event saw the DFW debuts of Rob Scaffold and Direk. More importantly, the DFW Championship belt was introduced and awarded. The first two matches were semi-finals, and the main event a finals match for the championship.
