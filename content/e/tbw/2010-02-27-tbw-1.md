This was the first of two events organized by [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md). It was held on Saturday, February 27, 2010, in Radom's Strefa G2 music club. While the card is all composed of Euroscene wrestlers, there was also a segment with Kamil Bazelak, then a MMA fighter for the KSW organization, where he claimed to join TBW and aim for their championship, yet to be unveiled.

Another Polish character was August, billed as a 215-cm tall giant.
However, August turned out to be a massive dissapointment.
In a breakfast TV segment from February 2010, Supron and Borkowski promote the upcoming event, with Vandamme and Cybernic Machine present at the table.
After a while, August joins them, and the other two wrestlers get into a heated word exchange, with Cybernic challenging Vandamme for the title he's carrying.
During this exchange, August was supposed to stand up and intervene, but only does so at Suprons command, which can loudly be heard over his microphone.
In his segment, August was only capable of executing basic wrestling moves, and stumbled around the ring, as if disoriented. He did not appear for TBW again.

Much later, in 2024, during a pre-show interview on [PTW#6](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), Paweł Borkowski reminisced about August. He joked that August was to not contact him again until he became world champion.
