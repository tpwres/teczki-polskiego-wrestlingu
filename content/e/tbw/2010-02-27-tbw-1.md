This was the first of two events organized by [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md). It was held on Saturday, February 27, 2010, in Radom's Strefa G2 music club.

While the card is all composed of Euroscene wrestlers, there was also a segment with Kamil Bazelak, then a MMA fighter for the KSW organization, where he claimed to join TBW and aim for their championship, yet to be unveiled. Another Polish character was August, a monk-like character, billed as a 215-cm tall giant.
However, August turned out to be a massive disappointment.

In a breakfast TV segment from February 2010, [Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md) and [Borkowski](@/w/pawel-borkowski.md) promoted the upcoming event, with Vandamme and Cybernic Machine present at the table.
After a while, August joined them, and the other two wrestlers got into a heated word exchange, with Cybernic challenging Vandamme for the title he was carrying.
During this exchange, August was supposed to stand up and intervene, but only did so at Supron's command, clearly heard via his microphone.

During the show, August interfered in the Bjørn Sem vs Ivan Kiev match, beating up both of them and rendering the match no contest. Kamil Bazelak entered from the crowd and stood up to him; they brawled out of the venue.
August was only capable of executing basic wrestling moves and seemed to stumble around the ring. He did not appear for TBW again.

Much later, in 2024, during a pre-show interview for [PTW #6](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), [Paweł Borkowski](@/w/pawel-borkowski.md) reminisced about August. He joked that August was to not contact him again until he became a world champion.
