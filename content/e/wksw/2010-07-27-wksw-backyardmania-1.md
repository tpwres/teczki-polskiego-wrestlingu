Backyardmania was the first cross-promotion backyard supershow.

Following the inception of [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) just the year before, plenty of backyard wrestlers left the amateur scene to train with Poland's first professional promotion, leaving non-pro groups largely stagnant. In early Spring 2010 someone known as Chudy (_Skinny_) from Wołów had the idea for a major backyard event, drawing the attention of a lot of people on wrestling forums. Organised by [WFW](@/o/wksw.md), Backyardmania took place on 11.07.2010 in Wołów, although only four people attended, out of 20 that declared interest in participating in the show.

## Card

  - 'TLK'
  - s: Hardcore Match
{% end %}

### Highlights

* TLK flew in from Scotland, much to everybody's surprise.
* VebVe vs TLK included thumb tacks, traffic cones and shopping carts. TLK bled profusely.
* According to a report on [Attitude forum][atti], VebVe became the first PSW Hardcore Champion. While "PSW" refers the Polish wrestlers scene, it is unknown if the match was indeed for a Championship title, or if the author of the post was being figurative.
* Nothing is known about the second match.
