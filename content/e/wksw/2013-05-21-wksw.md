Chudy appeared as "Pan Chudalewski" (_Mister Skinnylewski_) - likely a jab at ["Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md).

According to the source this was episode #50, Dziku and Pitero were present at the show, and also there was arm wrestling in addition to typical in-ring action. No further details are known.
