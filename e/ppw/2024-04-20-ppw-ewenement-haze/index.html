<h1>PpW Ewenement Haze</h1>

<p>Ewenement Haze was an event by <a href="/o/ppw/">PpW Ewenement</a>, taking place on Saturday April 20, 2024.
The original venue was to be <a href="/v/waldorffa25/">Waldorffa 25</a>, but due to miscommunication, it turned out that it's already booked for the night, and PpW had to find a replacement.
The new venue was Praga Centrum, a music and event venue with a large outdoor garden, located in Warsaw's Praga district.
According to Facebook posts, the ring wast to be set outdoors, later the plans changed and the show was held indoors after all.
The set featured a full stage and elevated ramp leading to the ring, with full size titan-tron display playing videos for wrestler's entrances.
The event's name refers to cannabis, whose many strains are often named &quot;Something + Haze&quot;.
This in turn, is a reference to the date, which, together with the number 420 are often associated with cannabis culture.</p>
<p>The foreign guests for this event were:</p>
<ul>
<li>German wrestler Nick Schreier. In 2021, Nick, in his third ever match recorded on Cagematch, appeared for <a href="/o/mzw/">MZW</a> at <a href="/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals/">Project 8: Golden Road Finals</a>.</li>
<li>Danish wrestler Benny Bacchus, who competes mostly in Denmark and Sweden</li>
<li>German wrestlers Joshua Amaru and Aytac Bahar, returning as a tag team. Their previous appearance was at <a href="/e/ppw/2023-05-06-ppw-mistrzowskie-rozdanie/">Mistrzowskie Rozdanie</a>.</li>
<li>Dominican wrestler Rambo, with 16 years of in-ring experience, mostly on the German scene. This is not his first time in Poland however: back in 2010 he appeared in a <a href="/e/tbw/2010-06-05-tbw-2/">tag team match</a> for <a href="/o/tbw/">Total Blast Wrestling</a>.</li>
<li>Ukrainian wrestler Alex Arthur. While this is his first appearance for PpW, he already wrestled for MZW a number of times, starting in 2016.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="build-up-to-the-event">Build-up to the event</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mister Z defeated Ricardo Diesel for the #1 Contender spot. PpW Champion Feager defends his newly won title in the main event.</li>
<li>In the 4/20 ladder match, the object hung above the ring is to be a small bag of cannabis.</li>
<li>Stanislaw Van Dobroniak is defending the PpW Ultraviolent championship against Alex Arthur. In a promo released on social media, he compared his opponent to a beaver, referencing a popular meme at the time.</li>
<li>Nick Schreier, before the official announcement, leaked his involvement on Instagram, listing dates and cities of his bookings in April.</li>
<li>Pure Gold (Gabriel Queen and Vic Golden) are set to appear in a tag team match, after their surprise reunion at the previous event.</li>
<li>7 matches and a <a href="/o/ppw/#2023-prime-time-transfers-professional-ring">new ring</a> were confirmed on Facebook, in the post that advertised Baklava Club's involvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commentary: Szymon Modzelewski, Konrad &quot;Joker&quot; Grześkiewicz <br />
Host: &quot;OG&quot; Michael HT <br />
Referees: Karol Górski, Kornel, Johnny Blade (special guest ref for the main event)</p>
<h3 id="full-report">Full report</h3>
<p>Show opens with host &quot;OG&quot; Michael HT entering the ring. He hypes up the crowd.
Referee Karol Górski is introduced and the announcements for first match start.</p>
<p>Timestamps refer to the YouTube video linked in the <a href="/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze/#references">References</a> section, and mark the start of wrestler entrances, not the opening bell.</p>
<h4 id="triple-threat-match-gustav-gryffin-w-jakob-sigmarsson-v-nick-schreier-v-samson">Triple Threat Match: Gustav Gryffin (w/Jakob Sigmarsson) v Nick Schreier v Samson</h4>
<p>Timestamp: <code>1:01:07</code></p>
<p>Gryffin makes his entrance accompanied by Sigmarsson to a chorus of boos and &quot;get the f*** out&quot; chants.
Nick Schreier hits the ring to a moderate pop, while Samson enters to a large pop. He's over with the crowd big time.</p>
<p>The match starts with both Samson and Schreier (as babyfaces) forming an alliance against Gryffin.
A sequence of double team moves from the babyfaces follows, which the crowd rewards with &quot;This is awesome&quot; chants.
With Gryffin laid out, Schreier and Samson fight 1 on 1. Gryffin makes a comeback, fighting off both babyfaces. The match dynamic changes to every man for himself.
Samson attempts a top rope splash on Schreier, but Sigmarsson pulls Samson out of the ring and beats him down. Gryffin steals a pin and wins the match.</p>
<p>Winner: Gustav Gryffin</p>
<h4 id="tag-team-match-pure-gold-gabriel-queen-vic-golden-v-baklava-club-aytac-bahar-joshua-amaru">Tag Team Match: Pure Gold (Gabriel Queen &amp; Vic Golden) v Baklava Club (Aytac Bahar, Joshua Amaru)</h4>
<p>Timestamp: <code>1:19:50</code></p>
<p>Pure Gold make their entrance to a huge babyface reaction, crowd sings their &quot;Best of both worlds&quot; theme song.</p>
<p>Before the bell, we see each team climb the corners for crowd reactions. Pure Gold get huge pop, Baklava get booed.
Golden and Bahar start off with some back and forth. Golden takes Aytac to his corner and tags in Gabriel Queen.
Double team sequence on Bahar. Bahar tags Joshua Amaru in, back and forth, Vic is tagged in, some double team moves on Joshua.
Aytac hits Golden from outside the ropes, allowing Joshua to get the upper hand. Aytac tags back in, they dominate Vic Golden some more.</p>
<p>The crowd sings &quot;Polska, biało-czerwoni&quot; (<em>Poland, red-and white</em>, set to the tune of <em>Go West</em>, often used to cheer for the national sport teams) to encourage Golden.
Referee is distracted and Baklava choke Golden in their corner. Queen, trying to interfere, only makes matters worse, prolonging the distraction.
Crowd is not happy with the referee. Golden tries to fight Baklava off and crawls back to his corner. He jumps for a hot tag, but Joshua drags Queen off the apron at the last minute.
Aytac uses the opportunity to lay Vic out once again with a clothesline.
Gabriel Queen has seen enough and attempts to enter the ring, but referee holds him back once again - allowing the heels to double team Golden again.
Finally, Queen is tagged in, he lays both Baklava members out with a sequence of moves. Pure Gold double team Aytac in their corner.
They have Bahar in the middle of the ring, ready to hit their double team finisher, but Amaru drags Golden out of the ring.
Baklava Club hit a 3D on Queen for a 2-count. All hell breaks loose, then finally Pure Gold are alone with Aytac in the ring.
They hit him with Golden shower (flying European uppercut + leg sweep combination) and Golden pins Aytac for a win.</p>
<p>Winners: Pure Gold</p>
<p>Show of respect between two teams, they shake hands, Baklava raise the victors' hands... only to lay them out with low-blows.
They beat Pure Gold down and celebrate their &quot;victory&quot; in the ring.</p>
<h4 id="critical-420-ladder-match-for-20g-of-marijuana-benny-bacchus-v-isnorr-v-rafi-v-goblin">Critical 420 Ladder Match for 20g of marijuana: Benny Bacchus v Isnorr v Rafi v Goblin</h4>
<p>Timestamp: <code>1:45:36</code></p>
<p>The trophy (20g of marijuana, declared to be CBD) is hung high above the ring.</p>
<p>All 4 men square off, Rafi taunts everyone else. They beat him down.
Isnorr stays in the ring with Rafi, while Goblin and Bacchus bring a ladder from the entrance ramp.
Bacchus quickly climbs the ladder and reaches for the trophy, but Goblin drops the ladder. Benny accidentally grabs the trophy bag, and falls into the ring with it.
In an unplanned development, babyfaces signal the referee, who retrieves the trophy, climbs the ladder and hangs it back. The bell rings once again and the match resumes.
This moment was featured in <a href="https://youtu.be/2azqxchwafo?t=731">Botchamania 493</a>, at the 12:10 minute mark.</p>
<p>Goblin and Bacchus each try to climb the ladder to grab the prize, but neither can get the upper hand.
Isnorr drops them and now he's alone in the ring with Rafi. Goblin comes back with a kendo stick, Bacchus with another ladder.
Goblin and Bacchus stand on opposite sides of the ladder. They realize they can just share the stash, hug and embrace. Crowd is chanting &quot;zajeb bucha&quot; (<em>Blaze it</em>).
Just as Goblin is about to win the match, Rafi drags him off the ladder with an RKO.
Rafi is alone on the ladder and nearly has the trophy in his hands, but Goblin and then Bacchus stop him.
Goblin and Bacchus continue to work as a team against the other two.
Isnorr asserts dominance, lays the babyfaces out. He sets up the table on the ramp, puts Goblin on it and bodyslams Benny on top of him - the table breaks.
Rafi tries to sneak past for a win, but is stopped by Isnorr as well.
Rafi makes a comeback, puts Isnorr through a horizontal ladder and attempts to climb. Bacchus makes a save, with the help of Goblin they put Rafi through a table.</p>
<p>All four men climb the ladders and brawl, only to fall off them. Benny is alone on the ladder and has the match won, but sees Isnorr attempting to choke Goblin out with a ladder.
He chooses loyalty over victory, saving Goblin with a superman punch to Isnorr. Goblin and Rafi are last men standing, they climb the ladder and brawl.
Goblin spits green mist into Rafi's face, then retrieves the trophy for a win.</p>
<p>Winner: Goblin</p>
<p>Goblin and Benny share the stash, planning to smoke it from a bucket, but before they can complete the ceremony, Gustav Gryffin appears out of nowhere
and lays Goblin out with a chair, then bucket to the head for good measure. He steals the stash from Goblin, then cuts a promo explaining himself.
He wants revenge for his loss on <a href="/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og/">Turbo OG</a> and challenges Goblin for a rematch at the next show.
The crowd urges Gustav to return the stash, so he rips the packet in half and throws the contents on the ground.</p>
<p>In comes Michael HT and starts an in-ring charity auction for Scooby the dog who requires urgent treatment... with everyone still laid out. The picture of the dog (signed by PpW roster) is sold for 1200 zł (about 280EUR at that time). The show goes to a break.</p>
<h4 id="break-interviews-conducted-by-joker">Break, interviews conducted by Joker</h4>
<ul>
<li>Samson: he is not upset about his loss. He hints that his next match will be in singles competition.</li>
<li>Gustav Gryffin (w/Jakob Sigmarsson): Gryffin says he does not care about morals, insults everyone and lays out his plan to become PPW Champion.
He claims that attack on Goblin was a sign of care - drugs and alcohol hold Goblin back and he can become a better wrestler without them.
Then tells the announcer to fuck off and leaves.</li>
<li>Pure Gold - they are happy about their win and not much concerned about Baklava laying them out (just small itch in the balls). Asked about future opponents, they would like to fight Gustav Gryffin and a partner of his choosing.</li>
<li>Isnorr: he confirms his plans to become PpW Champion. He thanks Biesiad Strong for igniting his passion towards hardcore wrestling and challenges Stanisław Van Dobroniak for the PPW European Ultraviolent Championship</li>
<li>Rafi: he claims that he was cheated out of the win by a bad referee, calls PpW &quot;fucking backyard&quot;. He insults Goblin and is happy for Gryffin taking away the trophy - as long as Goblin does not have it.</li>
<li>Benny Bacchus: he's happy that Goblin won and wants to party after the show.</li>
<li>Goblin: comes in, barely walking, Joker holds him up, and helps him sit down. Asked about Gustav, he says &quot;I hate him, he stole my weed&quot;.
Goblin says that Turbo OG match was not really meaningful to him, but now, Gustav made the issue personal. Goblin accepts the challenge, and wants it to be a hardcore match for #1 contender to PPW Championship.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rambo-v-biesiad-strong">Rambo v Biesiad Strong</h4>
<p>Timestamp: <code>2:53:50</code></p>
<p>The stipulation for this match is: Biesiad earns a contender match against Mister Z if he wins. However, should he lose, he gets his long hair shaved bald.</p>
<p>Back from the break, Michael HT is in the ring. He announces referee Kornel who comes out from the stage to a big ovation.
Both competitors fight to the stage area with Mr Z taunting Biesiad and handing Rambo the scissors - but never directly interfering.</p>

<h4 id="real-deal-mister-z-v-bill-feager-c-ppw-championship">&quot;Real Deal&quot; Mister Z v Bill Feager (c) - PpW Championship</h4>
<p>Timestamp: <code>3:18:07</code></p>
<p>Mr Z makes his entrance to a chorus of boos and insults from the crowd.
Next comes PpW Champion, Bill Feager, to some pop. He's using Volbeat's &quot;A Warrior's Call&quot; song as his entrance theme now.
Before Michael HT gets a chance to start the formal introductions, Mr Z grabs the mic to cut a promo, putting down Feager as a paper champion and putting himself over.
He offers Feager a deal: to lay down for him in the middle of a ring. He gives the mic to Feager for him to announce his decision... Feager directs the mic toward the audience,
who are now chanting &quot;kill him&quot;. He refuses, ridiculing Mister Z's &quot;deals&quot;.</p>
<p>They start a match in a competitive way, countering each other's moves. The crowd is having none of it, they only want violence and tables.
Feager with Undertaker's legdrop to Z's head on the apron. He continues the assault, but Z makes a comeback, methodically working Feager's left knee,
already injured in Feager's previous match against Kuningas (at <a href="/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia/">Miasto Bezprawia</a>).
He channels Ric Flair, imitating his slow walk and elbow drop, right into a figure four leg lock.

While Feager recovers, Mr Z brings a chair to the ring. He drops Feager with a chairshot to the back, then to the leg. Feager recovers and Z hits him with a chairshot to the head.</p>
<p>Referee checks on laid out Feager while Z is slowly circling around. He picks Feager up only to drop him again with a chop. Z with slingshot clothesline and cocky pin scores a 2 count.
Now, Mr Z slides a table into the ring. He works on Feager some more and sets the table up.
After a few hits, he tears Feager's shirt off and sets him up on the table. Feager somehow escapes the table, but Z quickly rams him into the other corner.
Z with a hurricanrana from the middle rope, puts Feager back on the table. As he climbs the top rope for his signature moonsault, Feager stands up and powerbombs Z through the table.
They both slowly recover on the ground and go into a kneeling brawl. They exchange blows and stand up, Feager with a Chokeslam for a 2 count.</p>
<p>Feager prepares a chair, while the kneeling Z slowly recovers, holding on to referee Kornel. Feager swings a chair, but Z pushes Kornel right into it. Monster heat for Mister Z, motionless referee falls out of the ring.
Z has Feager in a figure-4 once again, out come Gustav Gryffin and Jakob Sigmarsson.
Gustav lands some punches on Feager who's still in the submission hold, the crowd goes wild.

They drag the stunned referee back into the ring, ref is busted open. Very slow count, kick out at 2.</p>
<p>Now the heels set up Feager, supposedly for a triple powerbomb, but before Z picks him up, Biesiad appears out of nowhere.
He buckshots Z and goes for a ground and pound. The crowd goes nuts. Heels get the upper hand once again, but out comes Goblin to even the odds.
He brawls with Gryffin at ringside. Biesiad and Sigmarsson brawl to the backstage area, throwing ladders around.
Back to the ring, only the referee and competitors remain. Feager attempts a Pedigree, but Z counters into a Pedigree of his own for a near-fall.
They are both up, Z sets up Feager for a dropkick in the corner. He picks up Feager into powerbomb position but Feager counters with a sledgehammer to the head.

<p>Winner and still PpW Champion: Bill Feager</p>
<p>Feager celebrates in the ring with the championship and slowly makes his leave.
With him still on the ramp, Iron Maiden's &quot;The Trooper&quot; starts playing.</p>
<h4 id="segment-kapitan-bazooka-jerry-rich-mandecki">Segment: Kapitan Bazooka, Jerry &quot;Rich&quot; Mandecki</h4>
<p>Timestamp: <code>3:53:35</code></p>
<p>Jerry &quot;Rich&quot; Mandecky - PpW's major investor makes his entrance, accompanied by his bodyguard, Kapitan Bazooka.</p>
<p>They pass Feager by and enter the ring, Mandecky turns to Z, still seated in the corner.
Mandecky is clearly disappointed in Z, he shakes his head at him, looks at Bazooka and they both salute each other - it seems like he wants Bazooka to dispose of Mr Z.
In the middle of the salute, Bazooka flips Mandecky off, kick to the gut, STUNNER!</p>
<p>Bazooka rips his security gear off and shows a new set of gear underneath. He takes a chair, chairshot to Mandecky, followed by an elbow drop through a chair.
Z is still present, but leaves the ring. Bazooka prepares a black sack and puts it on Mandecky's head.
Bazooka's theme music plays. He slowly drags Mandecky out of the arena and drives him away in his car. The crowd cheers, &quot;PpW&quot; chants all over.</p>
<p>Michael HT is back in the ring, he repeats the result of the championship match.
Ring crew slowly clean the ring and we go for another break.</p>
<h4 id="ultraviolent-match-for-ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship-stanislaw-van-dobroniak-c-v-alex-arthur">Ultraviolent match for PpW European Ultraviolent Championship - Stanisław van Dobroniak (c) v Alex Arthur</h4>
<p>Timestamp: <code>4:18:20</code></p>
<p>The challenger enters with a full set of items, wearing a white PpW T-shirt. His equipment includes a suspiciously long cardboard box.
Out comes the champion with a chair and two championship belts: the PpW Ultraviolent Championship, and STHLM Wrestling's Capital City Championship.</p>
<p>Referee Kornel is unable to work after being busted open in previous match, so Michael HT announces his replacement.
Out comes Johnny Blade in a long leather coat.
He takes a mic to cut a promo. He says there is nobody crazy enough to officiate such a match - except for him.
Johnny drops his coat, showing a referee shirt underneath. He requests a deal: in exchange for officiating this match, Z is to lift his ban on Ultraviolent Championship titleshots.</p>
<p>In comes a female member of ring crew and whispers something to HT's ear. Michael confirms that Z agreed to Blade's conditions.
Dobroniak grabs a mic and he's having none of it: insults PpW and promises to kill everyone in the ring and Z as well.

Once they're both back in the ring, Dobroniak starts stomping and pummeling Alex. The crowd chants for blood.</p>
<p>Dobroniak elbow drops Alexander and gets a pinfall, but Johnny Blade is counting very slowly.
Dobroniak brings a chair into the ring and starts swinging on Arthur who's still on the mat.
Trash can lids come into action, he smashes a keyboard over Alexander's head.
He disposes of the keyboard and starts hitting Alexander with a crutch. Arthur is already busted open and his blood paints the ring.

Dobroniak argues with the referee, which gives Arthur a chance to make his comeback: with a chairshot to Dobroniak's head.
One more chairshot, keyboard shot and another chairshot. Dobroniak is clearly in pain.
Arthur hits him some more with additional items (seemingly a metal net) and attempts a pin.
This time Johnny counts at a normal pace, but Dobroniak kicks out anyway. They're both on their feet, Arthur with a Cody Cutter from the corner.
They brawl at ringside, both painted in blood.</p>
<p>The crowd is chanting &quot;too much blood&quot; now. Arthur drags Dobroniak back to the ring, sets up two chairs.
He empties his long cardboard box, which is full of light tubes, seats himself on a chair across from Dobroniak and they start exchanging blows.
Arthur takes out a light tube and smashes it on Dobroniak's head. He responds with a tube shot of his own. Many light tube hits re exchanged, Arthur gets the upper hand.

1,2,3, The bell rings, Stanisław van Dobroniak retains.</p>
<p>Winner and still PpW European Ultraviolent Champion: Stanisław Van Dobroniak</p>
<p>Dobroniak celebrates over laid out opponent and referee and makes his leave. Blade and Arthur recover, they make their leave to cheers from the crowd.</p>
<h4 id="finale">Finale</h4>
<p>Michael HT is reluctant to enter the ring once again, but eventually decides to. He announces that Jerry Rich Mandecky has been driven away outside Warsaw by a masked assailant named Kapitan Bazooka. He announces the next show, <a href="/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4/">Ledwo Legalne 4</a>, &quot;soon&quot;.</p>
<p>Additional interviews, once again conducted by Joker:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stanisław van Dobroniak: brags about his win and his title run, nearly 600 days long. He's full of himself, calls himself a god, warlord, and king.</li>
<li>Biesiad Strong: Joker asks him how many conspiracies he has thwarted, Strong jokingly remarks that all of them and one more.
He promises to always stop conspiracies and do the same to Mister Z at the next show. Joker asks Biesiad to avenge Kornel, he asks if Kornel is part of any conspiracy.
Joker denies, and Biesiad promises to avenge Kornel</li>
<li>Rambo: He thinks Biesiad was lucky to win and blames his loss on Z's failed interference. He wants a rematch under No Holds Barred rules.</li>
<li>Johnny Blade: Asked about the events from the championship match he refereed, Johnny does not care. He is happy about getting his title opportunity back and that's all that matters. He promises to beat Dobroniak for the title and leaves.</li>
<li>Mister Z: Asked about his part in Rambo's loss, Z circles around the question. He says he couldn't stop himself from watching the match, he really wanted Biesiad to get bald.
He will honor the deal - Biesiad won, so Z will face him. Blames his loss on Feager hitting Kornel with a chair, and gives himself a rematch.
But to honor the deal with Biesiad, he adds him to the match, making it a Triple threat. Biesiad v Mister Z v Feager for PpW Championship is on for the next show. <br />
Z mentions the stipulation that made Biesiad unable to challenge for PpW Championship ever again... but now that Mandecky is gone, and Z is the proper boss of PpW
and not just executive producer, he lifts the stipulation. <br />
Due to a contract between Mandecky and Z, should anything happens to Mandecky, Z legally succeeds him as the PpW owner. <br />
Regarding Bazooka, he denies ordering him to attack Mandecky - Mandecky is treating everyone like dogs, so Bazooka just had enough.
Closing comment from Z - are you all happy that I don't have a belt? But I have PpW! He flips off the camera.</li>
<li>Alex Arthur: He feels like after a good fight. He likes the Ultraviolent belt, he showed he can hang with Dobroniak, so he wants a rematch down the line. Joker suggests a triple threat including Johnny and Arthur loves the idea. He leaves with a PpW chant toward the camera.</li>
