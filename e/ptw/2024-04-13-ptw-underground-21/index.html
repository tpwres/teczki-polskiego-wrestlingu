<h1>PTW Underground 21</h1>

<p>PTW Underground 21 was an event by <a href="/o/ptw/">Prime Time Wrestling</a>, held on Saturday, April 13, 2024.</p>
<p>Initially PTW announced that the event will be held in Gliwice, a city in the Silesian Metropolis. However, fans who bought tickets, surprised at the actual venue location, asked for confirmation on social media. PTW confirmed the location to be in Kozłów, a village about 10km west of Gliwice.</p>
<p>The venue is listed as Dworek Pod Platanami, which is a hotel and restaurant, primarily organizing weddings. However, it neighbors a set of sport facilities - tennis courts and an indoor beach volleyball court, which <em>may</em> be the actual venue.</p>
<p>It was the go-home show for <a href="/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6/">PTW#6 Total Blast From The Past</a>. According to PTW's announcement post, Underground shows will move permanently to Saturday, and to a new location. This is likely to what the &quot;new season&quot; in the promotional material for <a href="/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush/">PTW#5</a> referred to.</p>

<p>Commentary: Łukasz &quot;Typowy Balik&quot; Baliński. Due to him working solo, the show saw a lot of guest commentators. <br />
Ring announcer, host, guest commentary, authority figure: Arkadiusz &quot;Pan&quot; Pawłowski <br />
Guest commentary: Olgierd, Marco Hammers (during the other's match) <br />
Sponsor representative: Łukasz Okoński, for Comedy Show <br />
Referees: Klaudiusz, Seweryn</p>
<h3 id="full-report">Full report</h3>
<p>As usual, Pawłowski makes a full entrance to open the show. Once again, he goes back to the practice of clapping for sponsors, but now adding a clap appreciating the fans as well.</p>
<h4 id="budapest-bastards-open-challenge">Budapest Bastards Open Challenge</h4>
<p>Bastards make their entrance. Renegade cuts a pre-match promo, hyping the meaning of Bastards' title win and inviting the mystery opponents. Out comes Marcelito, followed by Axel Fox. A competitive match, finished in an unfortunate fashion. The lights go out. Initally it sees like a set-up for interference (presumably by Sinister Kingdom), but it turns out to be just a power outage. The show goes into a 30 minutes break, and live video transmission is interrupted. The match finishes in complete darkness, Bastards retain.</p>
<h4 id="caravaggio-vs-el-ogre">Caravaggio vs El Ogre</h4>
<p>Vincent Caravaggio makes a pre-match promo, insulting the public and his opponent. He gets some heat from the audience, with chants for a guillotine (&quot;gilotyna&quot;) mocking his &quot;aristocratic&quot; heritage.
A short match, after working El Ogre's leg and some comebacks, Caravaggio gets a submission win with an ankle lock.
After his win, Vincent advertises a discount for his new T-shirt. The initial price of 1000 zł is dropped to 100 zł for the poor fans to afford.</p>
<h4 id="kaiden-vs-olgierd">Kaiden vs Olgierd</h4>
<p>Olgierd enters sporting new gear. Previously in street clothes, now changed to professional trunks. Post-match, Legia Łysych starts an attack on Kaiden, but <a href="/w/nano-lopez/">Nano Lopez</a> makes the save, seemingly forming a new tag team.</p>
<p>Marco Hammers was on guest commentary for his team partner's match.</p>
<h4 id="longman-vs-taras">Longman vs Taras</h4>
<p>In Longman's Confession segment, he moves away from always acknowledging public support (previously calling cheering fans &quot;his Pokemon&quot;).
&quot;Thank you&quot; chants are met with &quot;shut up&quot; response from Longman. No mention of Rzeźniczek and authority angle from <a href="/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush/">Gold Rush</a>. The story seemingly pivots to Pawłowski and Paka vs Longman.
Longman confirms that he is behind every injury that Paka sustained (off-screen attack on Taras in 2022, Boro's injury) and vows to put them on the shelf for good.
He makes flirty remarks towards Pawłowski's girlfriend Karolina, claiming she was aroused by the sight of her boyfriend beaten down, but then puts her down, saying she needs to drop at least 30 kg to earn Longman's attention.
This prompts Pawłowski to storm the ring and get physical with Longman, with security keeping them apart. Taras' music plays and he storms the ring, immediately getting into a brawl with Longman (music still playing).</p>
<p>In their match, Longman is working hard to re-injure Taras' arm. Post-match, he hits Taras with <em>At Your Service</em> (F5) on the chair and con-chair-to for good measure. <a href="/w/disco-pablo/">Disco Pablo</a> made a save, but only after the attack is finished. He checks on Taras and tries to revive him, to no avail. Taras is stretchered out of the arena.</p>
<p>Pawłowski was on guest commentary for this match.</p>
<h4 id="max-speed-vs-iskra">Max Speed vs Iskra</h4>
<p>In a short match-up, Max Speed gets his first win in PTW with SpeedForce (lungblower).</p>
<p>A post-match segment between Iskra and S.Rafał follows. Rafał offers Iskra his friendship, additionally stating that he drops his &quot;Srafał&quot; identity and wants to be known as &quot;Alex Brave&quot; (ringname change).
Iskra leaves Brave alone in the ring, Disco Pablo makes his entrance and dispatches them both. Longman storms the ring to goad Pablo into attacking and immediately runs away, playing some mind games.</p>
<h4 id="marco-hammers-vs-diana-strong">Marco Hammers vs Diana Strong</h4>
<p>Marco Hammers gained muscle, he is visibly larger than in his previous appearances. In a pre-match promo, Hammers and Olgierd put Diana and all women down, then present a new &quot;championship&quot; - <em>PTW Intergender Championship</em>, a joke belt made of cardboard. They force a referee to hold the belt up as if it was an actual title defense.</p>
<p>This is a competitive match, with a lot of aggression from Strong. Hammers wins with a variation of Fisherman Buster, after multiple interferences from Olgierd.
Post-match, Hammers and Olgierd celebrate a championship &quot;defense&quot; with confetti.</p>
<p>Pawłowski invites Hammers back to the ring, and in comedic fashion goads him into cleaning the confetti with a broom.
President of Comedy Show (one of the sponsors), Łukasz Okoński is invited to the ring and introduced by Pawłowski. Together, they mock Hammers' cleaning skills. Eventually Hammers is dismissed and celebrates his &quot;defense&quot; once again.
During the promos, Pawłowski made conflicting remarks whether Hammers' title is an actual, PTW recognized championship. Later, in Facebook results, there was a mention of imaginary champions, which implies the title is still unsanctioned.</p>
<h4 id="main-event-puncher-vs-marius-al-ani">Main event: Puncher vs Marius Al-Ani</h4>
<p>Pawłowski starts to announce main event of the evening, but is cut off by Sinister Kingdom's entrance music. <a href="/w/sinister/">Sinister</a> and <a href="/w/dziedzic/">Dziedzic</a> (sporting different facepaint than usual) make their way to the ring.
In an unusal fashion for them, they cut a less serious promo, celebrating the demise of Paka, whose 2 out of 3 members are on the shelf.
The celebration was comedic, over the top, full of jokes, complete with blowing party horns.
The team declares they don't need tag team belts, as they already have their own belts (presenting the belts from their trousers) and that they are already gold themselves.
They issue a warning to Nano Lopez, King Kaiden as well as the rest of PTW roster. They are cut-off by Spartan with a mic on the entrance aisle.
He reminds the fans who he is and that he wants revenge for an injury, one that Dziedzic was a part of. He quickly dispatches both Sinister Kingdom members and celebrates in the ring, to a pop from audience.
As Sinister Kingdom make their exit, Spartan chases them to the backstage area.</p>
<p>Puncher cuts his usual pre-match promo. After a competitive match-up he defeats Marius Al-Ani with <em>Wylew</em> (superman punch). He defends his title and wins WWA Championship to become double champion - although there was no mention of unifying both titles.
Post-match, Puncher brags about his win and makes shots at Baba-Thunder. He mocks him for losing his job in WWE and promises to do the same here in PTW, supposedly in a match at <a href="/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6/">PTW 6: Total Blast From the Past</a>.</p>
<p>Marius Al-Ani gets pop for his effort and leaves the arena, upset about his loss.
Pawłowski closes the show, announcing next shows, plugging the lottery and mentioning a 20% discount for local pizzeria.</p>
