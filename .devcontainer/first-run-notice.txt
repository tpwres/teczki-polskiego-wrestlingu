After the environment loads, press Ctrl-Shift-B (Cmd-Shift-B on Macs). This starts Zola in the background, rendering the project.
Alternatively, run this command in the terminal:

zola serve -i 0.0.0.0 -p 1111 -u /

Then, switch to the Ports panel, you should see two entries. Select the one that says `Zola Server (1111)`
in the Port column. Hover your mouse pointer over the Forwarded Address in that row, and click either the globe icon to
open in a new tab, or the split-window icon to open to the side of the active editor.

‚ôªÔ∏è No autoreloads ‚ôªÔ∏è

Your changes will not be rendered immediately. Reloading the tab or window may briefly
display an error message, but after a couple of seconds, the page will be available again.
If the process is stuck, return to the terminal, then press Ctrl-C to stop the process. 
Then, just rerun the command to include your latest changes.
