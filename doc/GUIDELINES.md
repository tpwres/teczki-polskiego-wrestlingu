# General guidelines

- Write in English. While the site is about Polish wrestling only, it's more useful that way. If there's demand, we may allow articles in Polish to accompany English-language ones.
- No AI-generated garbage. Everything is written and accepted by actual humans.

# Describing events

- Event page is always named `YYYY-MM-DD-org-event-name.md`
- If there's more than one org, separate them by underscores: `YYYY-MM-DD-org1_org2-event-name.md`
- If possible, link to social media pages linked to the event. Link to cagematch if listed there.
- If available, link to press coverage of the event, and notable references (e.g. Wikipedia, WrestleMap).
- If available as VOD, link to wherever it can be found currently. Free and paid options. Not just the streaming service, but a link to the relevant video page. This may mean a youtube link, but also a Fite, Dazn, or other more obscure video sites. They will get stale, but there's not much we can do here.
- Intro text should reference time and date, and if relevant, any circumstances which may have caused such a date or event.
- If possible, describe relevant storylines as they were going into the event. Most importantly, existing feuds.
- If possible, describe any important storyline results, such as someone turning heel, leaving a faction etc.
- Real-life events, if related, are also allowed.
- List matches in the `{{ card() }}` block. A separate document describes how it works.
- An event needs more than one link to prove it happened - something other than Cagematch.

# Describing wrestlers and other talent

- Talent are:
  - wrestlers
  - managers
  - valets
  - ring announcers
  - MCs
  - authority figures
  - referees
- In general, if someone steps into the ring and either talks or takes bumps, they are considered talent.
- Provide basic information: billed height and weight, place billed from, current and past gimmicks.
- Link to social media accounts they may have as wrestlers. Link to notable references (Wikipedia is notable). Link to cagematch if they have a profile.
- If known, describe their way into wrestling - where they debuted, who trained them. If they have other sports background or achievements, it's good to list them. All sport disciplines are allowed - not only combat sports.
- If they have a wrestling career outside Poland - briefly describe it (e.g. "trained in WxW Academy, and performed on a number of WxW shows in 2023").
- Describe any long-term storytelling related to their character.
- If they moved organizations, you can divide their article into sections marked with org name and years active.
- Talent will have their career section and matches list auto-generated from events. Don't try to create one manually. For non-wrestlers, an option in the front matter disables that section.

# Describing titles and championships

- Championships belong on an organization's page, in their own section.
- Matches where that championship is contended should link to that section.
- There are plans to have the title holder list generated automatically from events.

# Real name policy

- **Real names only allowed with consent**
- With the exception that if someone appears under their real name, it's fair to publish it.
- Even if already published elsewhere (e.g. Cagematch, Wikipedia, other fan sites)
- That also means no linking to **personal**, non wrestling-related social media profiles.
- If talent uses their real-name accounts as wrestling accounts, it's okay to link to it, even if this exposes their real name.

# Talent not from Poland

- If they appeared in at least one match that took place in Poland, they can have a page.
- Don't copy the entire Wikipedia article, just link to it. Follow the general guidelines. Focus on their time in Poland.

# Events not in Poland

- Not allowed as event pages.
- However, if an organization was named and involved in an event held outside of Poland, it's worth a mention on that organization's page.

# Organizations not from Poland

- Allowed as organization pages if they held an event in Poland (this means WWE can have a page).
